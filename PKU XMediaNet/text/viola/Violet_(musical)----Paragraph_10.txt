When she gets out at the Fort Smith station, Monty is there waiting. His efforts at sympathy make plain to her that her face has not changed at all. Crushed, she rejects Monty’s invitation to marry him before he ships out to Vietnam. Flick is also at the station and recognizes that Violet has changed, though her scar has not. He entreats her to stay with him (“Promise Me, Violet [Reprise]”). At first she refuses, but her younger self appears and stops Violet from rejecting what she wants most. Violet’s healing is complete when she takes Flick’s hand and commits to a new life with him (“Bring Me to Light”).
