The viola is similar in material and construction to the violin. A full-size viola's body is between 25 millimetres (0.98 in) and 100 millimetres (3.9 in) longer than the body of a full-size violin (i.e., between 38 and 46 centimetres (15 and 18 in)), with an average length of 41 centimetres (16 in). Small violas typically made for children typically start at 30 centimetres (12 in), which is equivalent to a half-size violin. For a child who needs a smaller size, a fractional-sized violin is often strung with the strings of a viola. Unlike the violin, the viola does not have a standard full size. The body of a viola would need to measure about 51 centimetres (20 in) long to match the acoustics of a violin, making it impractical to play in the same manner as the violin. For centuries, viola makers have experimented with the size and shape of the viola, often adjusting the proportions or shape to make a lighter instrument with shorter string lengths, but which still has a large enough sound box to create an unmistakable "viola sound". Prior to the eighteenth century, violas had no uniform size, the large violas (tenors) were designed to play the lower register viola lines or second viola in five part harmony depending on the instrumentation. Smaller violas nearer to the size of the violin were referred to as "alto violas" and were more suited to the higher register writing as in the viola 1 parts, as their sound was usually richer in the upper register, its size not being as conducive to a full tone in the lower register.
