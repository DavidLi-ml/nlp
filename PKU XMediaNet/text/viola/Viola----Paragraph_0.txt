The viola (/viˈoʊlə/; Italian pronunciation: [ˈvjɔːla]) is a bowed and plucked string instrument. It is slightly larger than a violin in size and has a lower and deeper sound than a violin. Since the 18th century it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family, between the violin (which is tuned a perfect fifth above it) and the cello (which is tuned an octave below it).The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C3, G3, D4, and A4.
