The concerti grossi: "Brandenburg Concerti" composed by J. S. Bach were unusual in their use of viola. The third concerto grosso, scored for three violins, three violas and lower strings with basso continuo requires occasional virtuosity from the violists, the sixth concerto grosso: Brandenburg Concerto No. 6 scored for 2 violas "concertino", cello, 2 violas da gamba, and continuo, in which the two violas were placed in the primary melodic role.
