The viola's bow has a wider band of horsehair than a violin's bow, which is particularly noticeable near the frog (or heel in the UK). Viola bows, at 70–74 grams (2.5–2.6 oz), are heavier than violin bows (58–61 grams (2.0–2.2 oz)). The profile of the rectangular outside corner of a viola bow frog generally is more rounded than on violin bows.
