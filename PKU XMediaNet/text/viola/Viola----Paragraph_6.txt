One of the most notable makers of violas of the twentieth century was Englishman, Arthur Smith, known as A.E. Smith, whose violas are sought after and highly valued. Many of his violas remain in Australia, his country of residence, where during some decades the violists of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra had a dozen of them in their section.
