Horses have a great sense of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly developed proprioceptionâ€”the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.
