Feeding, caring for and shoeing a one-ton draft horse is costly. The draft horseâ€™s metabolism is often similar to that of ponies in that draft horses have lower needs per bodyweight than light horse breeds, but because of their size, most are fed a significant amount of feed and hay per day. A grain feeding of only 0.3% of body weight is all drafts need. Drafts not subjected to extreme energy demands can do well on good quality grass.
