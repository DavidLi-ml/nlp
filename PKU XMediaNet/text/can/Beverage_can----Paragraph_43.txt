The similarly designed "Easy-open ecology end" was also invented by Ermal Fraze and Omar Brown. The patent application was filed also in 1975. This design reduced injuries and reduced roadside litter caused by removable tabs. The mechanism used a separate tab attached to the upper surface as a lever to depress a scored part of the lid, which folds underneath the top of the can and out of the way of the resulting opening.
