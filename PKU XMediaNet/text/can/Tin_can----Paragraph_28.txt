Steel from cans and other sources is the most recycled packaging material. Around 65% of steel cans are recycled. In the United States, 63% of steel cans are recycled, compared to 52% of aluminium cans. In Europe the recycling rate in 2011 is about 74%. While much recycling of tins occurs once the can hits the smelters other methods are also used. For instance some people use two tin cans to form the basis of a camp or survival stove, commonly fueled by rubbing alcohol or other alcohols, upon which small meals are cooked.
