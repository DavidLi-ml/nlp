Three-piece can construction results in top and bottom rims; in two-piece construction, one piece is a flat top and the other a deep-drawn cup-shaped piece that combines the (at least roughly) cylindrical wall and the round base; the transition between the wall and base is usually somewhat gradual. Such cans have a single rim at the top. Some cans have a separate cover that slides onto the top or sometimes is hinged.
