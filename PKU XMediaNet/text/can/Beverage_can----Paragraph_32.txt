In order to achieve primary aluminum for manufacturing, bauxite needs to be converted to alumina through a Bayer process. After this process, aluminum can be extracted from alumina. Subsequently, it goes through a process called aluminum smelting and ingot casting. Simply, these two stages require alumina to undergo an extremely hot temperature and high-energy bath. Following this process is hot rolling and cold rolling. This is ultimately done to cast the aluminum can into shape for further processing. Finally, the process of “ironing” is performed which forms the shape of the can.
