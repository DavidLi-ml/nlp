Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a toxic chemical compound present in commercially available tin can plastic linings and transferred to canned food. The inside of the can is coated with an epoxy coating, in an attempt to prevent food or beverage from coming into contact with the metal. The longer, warmer and the more acidic the food is in a can, the more BPA will leach out into it. In September 2010, Canada became the first country to declare BPA a toxic substance. In the European Union and Canada, BPA use is banned in baby bottles. The FDA failed to regulate BPA.(see Bisphenol A#US public health regulatory history) Several companies like Campbell's Soup announced to eliminate BPA from the linings of their cans, but will not state what chemical they will replace it with (see Bisphenol A#Chemical manufacturers reactions to bans).
