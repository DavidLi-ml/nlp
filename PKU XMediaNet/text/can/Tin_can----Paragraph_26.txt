The advent of pull tabs in beverage cans spread to the canning of various food products, such as pet food or nuts (and non-food products such as motor oil and tennis balls). The ends are known as easy open lids because they provide the convenience of opening without need for any tools or implements. An additional innovation developed for specifically for food cans has been a new design whereby the tab is bent slightly upwards, creating a larger surface area and allowing easier finger access under the tab.
