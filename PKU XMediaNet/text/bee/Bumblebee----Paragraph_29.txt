Bumblebees generally visit flowers that exhibit the bee pollination syndrome and these patches of flowers may be up to 1â€“2 km from their colony. They tend to visit the same patches of flowers every day, as long as they continue to find nectar and pollen there, a habit known as pollinator or flower constancy. While foraging, bumblebees can reach ground speeds of up to 15 metres per second (54 km/h).
