The true honey bees (genus Apis) are highly eusocial, and are among the best known of all insects. There are 29 subspecies of Apis mellifera, native to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Africanized bees are a hybrid strain of A. mellifera that escaped from experiments involving crossing European and African subspecies; they are unusually defensive.
