While the Ford F-150 has been the best-selling vehicle in the United States since 1982, the Ford F-150, or indeed any full-size pickup truck is a rare sight in Europe, where high fuel prices and very narrow city roads make it difficult to use on a daily basis. In America pickups are favored by low fuel prices, taxes and regulations that distort the market in favor of domestically built trucks, and a cultural attachment to the style.
