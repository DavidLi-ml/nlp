Full-size pickups and SUVs are an important source of revenue for GM, Ford, and FCA's Ram, accounting for more than two-thirds of their global pre-tax earnings, though the vehicles make up just 16 percent of North American vehicle production. The vehicles have a high profit margin and a high price, with 40 per cent of Ford F-150 selling for US$40,000 or more.
