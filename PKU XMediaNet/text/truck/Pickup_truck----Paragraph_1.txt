The term pickup is of unknown origin. It was used by Studebaker in 1913 and by the 1930s pick-up (hyphenated) had become the standard term. In Australia and New Zealand ute, short for utility, is used for both pickups and coup√© utilities. In South Africa people of all language groups use the term bakkie, a diminutive of bak, Afrikaans for bowl.
