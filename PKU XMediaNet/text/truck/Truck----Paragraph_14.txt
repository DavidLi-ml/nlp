Light trucks are car-sized (in the US, no more than 6,300 kilograms (13,900 lb)) and are used by individuals and businesses alike. In the UK they may not weigh more than 3,500 kilograms (7,700 lb), and are allowed to be driven with a driving licence for cars. Pickup trucks, called utes in Australia and New Zealand, are common in North America and some regions of Latin America, Asia and Africa, but not so in Europe, where this size of commercial vehicle is most often made as vans.
