Another configuration is called a triple transfer train, consisting of a "B" and "C" box. These are common on Nevada and Utah Highways, but not in California. Depending on the axle arrangement, a triple transfer can haul up to 129,000 kilograms (284,000 pounds) with a special permit in certain American states. As of 2007, a triple transfer costs a contractor about $105 an hour, while a A/B configuration costs about $85 per hour.
