Driving licensing has been harmonized throughout the European Union, so that common, albeit complex rules apply on all member states (see European driving licence). As an overview, to drive a vehicle weighing more than 7.5 tonnes (16,535 lb) for commercial purposes requires a specialist license (the type varies depending on the use of the vehicle and number of seats). For licenses first acquired after 1997, that weight was reduced to 3,500 kilograms (7,716 lb), not including trailers.
