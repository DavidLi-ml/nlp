Tank trucks are described by their size or volume capacity. Large trucks typically have capacities ranging from 5,500 to 11,600 US gallons (20,800 to 43,900 L; 4,580 to 9,660 imp gal). In Australia, road trains up to three cars long (known as A-Triple tankers) carry loads in excess of 100,000 L. Longer road trains transporting liquids are also in use.
