Some diesel engined pickups are modified to emit higher diesel exhaust and have been described as rolling coal. In an open defiance of environmental regulations by anti-environmentalists, changes are designed to produce visibly polluting sooty emissions and include the intentional removal of the particulate filter, as well as installing smoke switches and smoke stacks. Modifications may cost from $2,000 to $5,000. "It is a violation of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to manufacture, sell, or install a part for a motor vehicle that bypasses, defeats, or renders inoperative any emission control device....The CAA prohibits anyone from tampering with an emission control device on a motor vehicle by removing it or making it inoperable prior to or after the sale or delivery to the buyer." In addition to environmentalism concerns, the modifications increase health risks, particularly respiratory issues, as well as safety because the black coal can make visibility difficult.
