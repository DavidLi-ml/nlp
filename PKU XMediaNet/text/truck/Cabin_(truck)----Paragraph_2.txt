Cab over engine (COE) or flat nose, where the driver is seated on top of the front axle and the engine. The front doors are typically in front of and above the front tires. This design is almost ubiquitous in Europe, where overall truck lengths are strictly regulated. They were common in the United States and Canada but such body style in heavy duty type trucks lost prominence, when the legally permitted length was extended in the early 1980s. Nevertheless, COE's are still popular among medium and light duty trucks in the United States. To access the engine, the whole cab tilts forward, earning this design the name of tilt-cab. This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient path and trackways which require the additional turning capability of the cab over engine type. The operating conditions of these vehicles tend to be cooler than the conventional cab design and so the increased engine surface area used for cooling in hotter climates is not required. Access to a COE cab is commonly by steps forward of the front tires.
