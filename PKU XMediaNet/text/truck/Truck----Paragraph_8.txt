The federal government has rules for commercial vehicles, regulating how many hours a driver may be on the clock, how much rest and sleep time is required (e.g., 11 hours driving/14 hours on-duty followed by 10 hours off, with a maximum of 70 hours/8 days or 60 hours/7 days, 34 hours restart ), and many other rules. Violations are often subject to significant penalties. Instruments to track each driver's hours must sometimes be fitted.
