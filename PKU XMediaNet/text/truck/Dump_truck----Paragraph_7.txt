Common configurations for a standard dump truck include the four wheeler. (4x2) which has one powered rear axle, the six wheeler (6x2 or 6x4) with one or two powered rear axles, the tri-axle with one lift axle and two powered axles, and the quad with two lift axles and two powered axles. The largest of the standard European dump trucks is commonly called a "centipede" and has seven axles. The rear two axles are powered, the front axle is the steering axle, and the remaining four are lift axles. The intermediate axles are present to support the weight over the length of the chassis and sometimes to provide additional braking power. In the European Union, the dump truck configurations are 2, 3 and 4 axles. The 4-axle eight wheeler has two axles at the front and two at the rear and is limited to 32 metric tons (35 short tons; 31 long tons) gross weight in most EU countries. In the U.S. the most common large dump trucks, the "semi-dumps", have a 6x4 semi tractor and a two axle trailer. Although theoretically able to have a gross weight of 80,000 pounds, bridge formula laws usually reduce this.
