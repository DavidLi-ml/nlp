A semi bottom dump (or "belly dump") is a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle trailer with a clam shell type dump gate in the belly of the trailer. The key advantage of a semi bottom dump is its ability to lay material in a windrow, a linear heap. In addition, a semi bottom dump is maneuverable in reverse, unlike the double and triple trailer configurations described below. These trailers may be found either of the windrow type shown in the photo, or may be of the cross spread type, with the gate opening front to rear instead of left and right. The cross spread type gate will actually spread cereal grains fairly evenly the width of the trailer. By comparison, the windrow type gate leaves a pile in the middle. The cross spread type tend to jam and may not work well with coarse materials.
