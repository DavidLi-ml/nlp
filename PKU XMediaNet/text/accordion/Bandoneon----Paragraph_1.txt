The bandoneon, so named by the German instrument dealer, Heinrich Band (1821â€“1860), was originally intended as an instrument for religious and popular music of the day, in contrast to its predecessor, more folk music inclined German concertina (or Konzertina). Around 1870, German and Italian emigrants and sailors brought the instrument to Argentina, where it was adopted into the nascent genre of tango music, a descendant of the earlier milonga.
