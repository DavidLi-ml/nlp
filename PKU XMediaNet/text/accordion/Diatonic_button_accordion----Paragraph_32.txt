Three-row systems are also popular in Mexico and the United States (in Conjunto, Tejano, Zydeco and Cajun musics) and Colombia (in Vallenato and Folklor musics). Tunings include B♭/E♭/A♭, A/D/G, G/C/F, F/B♭/E♭ and E/A/D. The three-row fourth-apart configuration is known as the "international system."
