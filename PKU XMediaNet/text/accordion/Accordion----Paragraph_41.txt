The accordion appeared in popular music from the 1900s-1960s. This half century is often called the "Golden Age of the Accordion". Five players, Pietro Frosini, the two brothers Count Guido Deiro and Pietro Deiro and two Slovenian brothers Vilko Ovsenik and Slavko Avsenik, were major influences at this time.
