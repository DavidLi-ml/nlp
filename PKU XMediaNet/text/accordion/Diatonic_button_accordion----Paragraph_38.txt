The earliest semitone-apart system was C/C♯, and many variants have been used over the years, notably D/D♯ and G/G♯. However, since the mid-20th century two main systems have been in widespread use: the B/C system, used mainly for Irish and Scottish music, along with its larger cousin, the B/C/C♯ system (which is now little used outside Scotland); and the C♯/D system, somewhat less common, used mainly in Irish music. (Irish-American musicians of the mid-20th century used this system with the position of the rows reversed, i.e. D/C♯.)
