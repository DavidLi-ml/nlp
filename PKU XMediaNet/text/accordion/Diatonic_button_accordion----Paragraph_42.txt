Several distinct variations of the DBA have developed in different regions of the world. These include the Russian garmon, the Steirische Harmonika or Slovenian-style accordion that is popular in Alpine regions of Europe, the Swiss Schwyzer√∂rgeli and the Basque trikitixa; the last two combine single- and double-action (bisonoric and unisonoric) features. A common type of Italian organetto has a single melody row augmented with a very short half-row of between two and four buttons (often smaller in diameter than those on the main row) providing reversals only.
