As with other members of the concertina family, the bandoneon is held between both hands, with pushing and pulling motions forcing air through its bellows, which is routed through reeds by pressing its buttons. As a concertina, the bandoneon's buttons travel parallel with the bellows, versus perpendicular on an accordion.
