The Yellow-crowned woodpecker was originally described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name Picus mahrattensis. The taxonomic committee of the British Ornithologists' Union have recommended an alternative arrangement in which the genera Leiopicus and Dendrocoptes and are combined into a larger Dendropicos.
