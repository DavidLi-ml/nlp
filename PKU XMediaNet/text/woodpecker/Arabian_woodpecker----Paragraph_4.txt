Like other woodpeckers, the Arabian woodpecker feeds on insect grubs which it extracts from holes in tree trunks and branches with its long tongue. It also feeds on spiders, aphids, fig-wasps and flying insects. The nest is in a hole in the trunk or branch of a tree, usually below 6 m (20 ft), excavated in dead wood. The main breeding season is from March to May, but a second brood is sometimes reared in November in Yemen.
