Automatic floor scrubbers, also known as auto scrubbers, are a type of floor cleaning machine that are used to scrub a floor clean of light debris, dust, oil, grease or floor marks. These machines have either rotary(disk) or cylindrical scrubbing head and an automated system for dispensing cleaning solution and then vacuuming it up. So, in one pass over the floor, a user can dispense cleaning, scrub it into the floor, then vacuum it all up with an autoscrubber squeegee attachment at the back of the machine. Auto scrubbers have a separate dispensing(solution tank) tank and a collection(recovery tank) tank to keep your clean water from your dirty water and can be categorized into one of two main types: walk behind or riding.
