Rarely, a central vacuum system may become clogged, especially if the tubing was poorly installed, or if the system is abused by vacuuming sticky substances (such as paint or glue or wet foodstuffs). A homeowner can usually use simple tools and techniques to locate and remove the obstruction, or can hire a professional vacuum installer to do repairs. The flexible hose is often the location of a blockage, which can usually be dislodged by using a plumber's snake.
