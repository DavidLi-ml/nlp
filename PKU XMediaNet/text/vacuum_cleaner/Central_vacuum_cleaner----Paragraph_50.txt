Occasionally, the owner of a new house under construction may choose to pre-install vacuum tubing and control wiring in the walls, but to defer purchase of the central unit, hose, and tools to reduce cash flow requirements. Installing tubing and wiring for a central vacuum in new construction is definitely much easier if done before the drywall and other wall finishes. The short-term cost savings of deferring full system completion should be weighed against the great convenience of having a functional vacuum system, especially during the commissioning and move-in period, which generate more than the usual amount of debris to be cleaned up.
