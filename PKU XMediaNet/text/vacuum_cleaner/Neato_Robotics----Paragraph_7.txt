Major design changes were made in the separate BotVac model introduced March, 2014 (see above, models). Outwardly similar to the original XV line, the internal construction and features were expanded. Internal improvements were made in the XV-1x (late 2011), included in all models, with a stronger attachment of suspension springs inside the case, after a number of breakages of a weaker original design. The XV-21 models discontinued the charging plug on the vacuum itself, as the charging base was preferred; some units might have the plug but under a cover, and it could disappear with later system circuit boards; the plug was removed from revised User Guides. Changes were made in late 2012 to the charging base, using a lower capacity "brick" AC/DC adapter, and electronics changes making old chargers incompatible with newer models (with rev 64 system board); backwards compatibility of new chargers with old vacuums was maintained.
