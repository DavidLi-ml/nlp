Hybrid cyclonic filtered systems have been made, which use a rudimentary cyclonic motion to separate out larger dirt particles, but rely on conventional filter bags to trap remaining finer particles. True cyclonic systems are very effective in removing all but the finest particles, which are then exhausted directly outside, completely eliminating the need for replaceable filters and their consequent airflow restrictions. The exhaust from a good quality true cyclonic system does not contain any visible large particles, and contains far less debris than a typical clothes dryer exhaust.
