With the advancement in technologies used in autonomous robots, floor-scrubbing robots were created by combining the features of automatic floor scrubbers with self-control operations without an operator. Non-residential models such as HydroBot by Intellibot Robotics are suitable for education, retail, healthcare and manufacturing facilities. These commercial floor cleaning machines can clean 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) area in one hour.
