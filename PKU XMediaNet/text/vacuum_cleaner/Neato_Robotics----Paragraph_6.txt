In 2011, a more-expensive enhanced version was developed under contract for German appliance maker Vorwerk Kobold, distributed only in Germany as the Vorwerk VR-100, with some slow expansion later into other European locations. This model appears very similar to Neato vacuums and shares many parts, but had an additional spinning side brush extending beyond the case edge, for areas not normally reached, and a more powerful suction fan. The bristle front brush and pleated filter were introduced first on these German models and later in 2012 for Neato models. The Vorwerk unit was also powered by a higher capacity lithium-ion battery, long used in laptop computers, compared to the cheaper nickelâ€“metal hydride battery (NiMh) battery used in Neato models. Differences in details of the charging process for these different types of batteries, as well as the additional side brush motor, requires different firmware programs for each model's computer. Updates to these programs are delivered separately by each company in case of revisions.
