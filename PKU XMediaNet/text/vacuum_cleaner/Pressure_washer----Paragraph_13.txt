An insulator pressure washer is a mechanical high-pressure washer designed to remove contamination/pollution from overhead power line insulators with the power on (energized) using low conductivity water. Cleaning is necessary to prevent flashovers (high-voltage shorts to earth across the insulators), which can damage power line equipment.
