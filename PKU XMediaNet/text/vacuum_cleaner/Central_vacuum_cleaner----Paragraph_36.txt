A central vacuum system is generally considered by building owners to be a permanent fixture of the building where it is installed, similar to plumbing or electrical fixtures. A short-term renter would most likely lose any investment made in improving the property, unless a prior agreement were made with the property owner. Installation of a quality central vacuum increases the property value of a residence or commercial property.
