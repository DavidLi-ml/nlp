Automatic dustpans (e.g. "Vacpan" or "KickSweep") can be installed in the kickspace under a kitchen, bathroom, or workroom countertop, enabling a person to use a standard broom to sweep debris directly into a vacuum inlet located there. Alternatively, a "DrawerVac" inlet which pulls out like a drawer from the underside of a table or counter can be used to dispose of debris from a shop or kitchen work surface.
