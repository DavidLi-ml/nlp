Bag breakage is an issue that arises with filtered central vacuums. In a portable vacuum, if the filter bag fails, this condition becomes immediately obvious as a cloud of dust and dirt blows into the room. Although it creates a mess, at least the problem can be immediately brought under control by shutting off the appliance. By contrast, if the filter bag in a central unit should fail, little change may be noticed by the remote operator. In fact, the only perceivable change may be an increase in suction power as a clogged but broken bag is completely bypassed. If the filtered air is also used to cool the motor (a very typical design), the first clue that something is amiss may be when the motor completely seizes up due to dirt accumulating in the motor brushes, windings, or bearings. Such a failure can require complete replacement of the expensive central unit.
