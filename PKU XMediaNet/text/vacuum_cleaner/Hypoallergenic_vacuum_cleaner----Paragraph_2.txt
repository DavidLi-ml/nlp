HEPA filters alone are not enough for even the best vacuum cleaner to work effectively. Whether itâ€™s bagged or bagless, a truly hypoallergenic vacuum requires that it have a completely sealed system. All intake air must pass through the dirt capture and filtration systems before it exits the vacuum, any leaks will allow dust and allergens to be ejected back into the air you breathe before the HEPA filter has a chance to do its job, meaning the system itself is no longer HEPA grade despite the presence of such a filter. However, some users who suffer from dust mite allergies, evidence a preference for bagless technology; as most of the dirt is trapped inside the chamber via the use of cyclonic technology, which is, by design, a potentially inherently cleaner technology.
