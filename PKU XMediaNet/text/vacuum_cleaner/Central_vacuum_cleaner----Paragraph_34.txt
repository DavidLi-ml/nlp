Durable equipment â€” Good-quality central vacuum systems can last indefinitely, perhaps requiring replacement of the motor brushes once per decade of use. Besides using heavy-duty components, central vacuums avoid the damage caused by accidental dropping or collisions of portable equipment with fixed objects. Many manufacturers give a "Lifetime Limited Warranty" on all permanently installed components of a central vacuum system.
