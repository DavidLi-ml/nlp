To use a central vacuum, the vacuum hose is taken from storage and fitted with any needed cleaning accessories (such as a brush). The other end of the hose is inserted into a wall-mounted vacuum inlet, after opening the spring-loaded cover door. In some designs, opening the door switches on the vacuum motor; in other designs, insertion of the metallic hose-end fitting bridges two electrical contacts, signaling the motor to turn on. Other alternative designs feature a remote on/off switch located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, which communicates either via a pair of wires embedded in the hose, or via wireless signaling.
