An hypoallergenic vacuum cleaner uses suction and sometimes brushing to remove particles from flooring, carpet, and furniture and furnishings and purports to retain the vast majority (ideally at least 99.97%) within the vacuum system, which, if successful, would greatly reduce the amount of potential allergens in the environment in which it is used, as compared to regular vacuum cleaners in which most very fine dust and many allergens simply are too small for the system to trap and are released from the system along with the exhaust air. However, studies have shown that even vacuum cleaners featuring HEPA filters tend to release a large amount of allergens back into the air in the exhaust, although in general, more recent and more expensive models perform better than older and less expensive ones.
