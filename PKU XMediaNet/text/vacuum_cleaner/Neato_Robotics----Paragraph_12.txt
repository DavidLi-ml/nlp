Although the Neato firmware is compatible with their XV-11, XV-12, XV-15, XV-21 and XV-25 models, it is not compatible with the Vorwerk Kobold VR 100 (see above, Models) reportedly due to the altered charging of the VR100 which uses lithium ion batteries instead of Ni-MH batteries. The firmware revision is now identical between neato and VR100 models since the introduction of firmware 3.1.17844 although the upgrade software will detect respective brands and reject the upgrade accordingly. For some reason Vorwerk and Neato have chosen to use different mechanisms for the upgrade process for essentially the same task.
