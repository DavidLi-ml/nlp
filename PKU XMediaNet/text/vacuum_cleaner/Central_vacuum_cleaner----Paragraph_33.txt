Reduced damage and wear to furniture and walls â€” There is no heavy or awkward canister or other motorized unit to carry from room to room when vacuuming. Only a lightweight vacuum hose and the cleaning tool being used need to be carried. To further reduce wear to furniture feet and projecting baseboard corners, a soft woven "hose sock" can be installed over the corrugated vacuum hose.
