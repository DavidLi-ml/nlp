Neato XV robots originally supported user-upgradeable firmware via a mini USB port on the rear of the robot, via a (not included) mini-USB cable connected to a Windows or Mac PC. The updates were removed from the companies website in early November 2015. Firmware upgrades used to allow the company to correct some problems and to improve efficiency of the products without recalling and repairing them at a central location.
