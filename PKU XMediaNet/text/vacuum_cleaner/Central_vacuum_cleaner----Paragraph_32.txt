Compatible with standard tools and accessories â€” Most central vacuum hoses are compatible with a wide range of industry standard brushes and tools used with ordinary portable vacuum cleaners. In the US, the de facto standard size is 1-1/4 inch (3.175 cm) inside diameter for tools. For some accessories, it may actually be necessary to "bleed off" excessive suction, usually by partially opening a small bleed port on the side of the vacuum hose handle, provided for that purpose.
