Central vacuums can be equipped with either an electrical power brush or an air-driven power brush. The air-driven (or turbine) systems frequently are less expensive because they donâ€™t require electrical wires for power to be run to each wall inlet. Turbine-driven brushes tend to be noisier than electric brushes; the noise from either is more noticeable in the absence of the "vacuum whine" produced by portable vacuums. Many users find that the high suction of central vacuums is more than sufficient by itself for most casual cleaning jobs, but reserve a powered brush tool for more difficult tasks.
