Most autoscrubbers can't reach edges, corners, clean under obstructions such as drinking fountains, and can't fit into alcoves. Therefore, mopping is needed to clean areas the autoscrubber can't reach. Some manufacturers now produce Floor Scrubbers with Orbital / Oscillating brush decks allowing edges, corners and overhangs to be fully cleaned.
