At least one manufacturer (HP Vacuflo) produces a scaled-down central vacuum unit intended for installation in smaller individual apartments, condominiums, or even mobile homes. Such a unit could be installed without use of in-wall tubing, allowing later de-installation and removal. Unlike the larger cyclonic models produced by the same company, this compact unit uses conventional filter bags, but retains most of the other advantages of a central vacuum system. A different system, called "OnBoard", is designed for recreational vehicles (motor homes), and pleasure boats, and has an optional wet vacuuming capability.
