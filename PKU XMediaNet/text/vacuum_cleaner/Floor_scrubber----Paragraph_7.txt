When storing an autoscrubber, the solution and recovery tanks should be left open to allow ventilation and to prevent odors from building up Before charging battery-powered machines, check to make sure the water in the battery cells is covering the lead plates before charging. If the water level is low enough to expose the plates, Fill the cell with just enough water until the plates are covered. If batteries are discharged, never add water if the electrolyte is visible above the plates. When charging, the battery compartment should be left open for ventilation as hydrogen gases are emitted from the charging process. After charging, check the battery cells again. The water level should be 1/8 below the bottom of the fill well. If the level is low fill until it is 1/8 below the bottom of the fill well. If a battery is overfilled, the water can overflow which can damage the battery and make a mess.
