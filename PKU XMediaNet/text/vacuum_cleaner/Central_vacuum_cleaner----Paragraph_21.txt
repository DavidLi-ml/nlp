An alternative for storing vacuum hose is the "Hide-A-Hose" system, which uses suction to draw the hose into the vacuum tubing in the wall for storage. Hose lengths used are typically 30/40/50 ft (9/12/15 m). Successful installation of such systems requires special fittings, and careful design and workmanship, to ensure smooth hose retraction into the tubing for storage. A scaled-down 10-foot (3 m) version (such as "Spot by Vroom") is available for quick cleaning in locations such as mud rooms and laundry rooms. The original "Vroom" system, which is still available, uses suction to operate a cabinet-mounted hose reel with a 24 ft (7.3 m) hose, rather than storing the hose within the wall tubing.
