In March 2013, Neato Robotics announced its forthcoming Signature XV and Signature Pro models for April release in black, similar in appearance but possibly with a more powerful vacuum fan (no details specified except 50 per cent increased extraction; a different fan was used in Vorwerk Kobold VR-100 models); and assorted changes with details are pending April release.
