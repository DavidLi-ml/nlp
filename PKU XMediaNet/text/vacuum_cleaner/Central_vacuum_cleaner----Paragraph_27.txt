Complete removal of allergens and noxious odors â€” Central vacuums generally do not recirculate exhaust air back into the space being cleaned. This contrasts with the well-known acrid "vacuum smell" of fine dust and hot air exhausted from a portable vacuum. Instead, central vacuums exhaust spent air into a utility space, or directly outdoors. An external exhaust outlet can be easily concealed under a porch or behind shrubbery, but in any case is less obtrusive than a standard clothes dryer appliance vent.
