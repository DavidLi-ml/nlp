Two different diameters of thinwall (typically 20 gauge or "Schedule 20") plastic tubing have traditionally been used in the US. For years, HP Vacuflo advocated the slightly smaller 1 13‚ÅÑ16-inch (4.6 cm) tubing size (outside diameter), claiming that their studies showed that it was less likely to clog. However, that manufacturer has also switched to the de facto industry standard size of 2-inch (5.1 cm) outside diameter tubing and corresponding fittings. In most cases, the end user need not be aware of the tubing size in a central vacuum system, but the tubing size must be considered when extending, modifying, or repairing a system. Size adapters have been made to allow interconnection of the two sizes when necessary.
