After each use, the dispensing(solution) and especially the collection(recovery)tanks should be emptied and rinsed out to prevent dirt build up. Also, the pads/brushes, vac hose, and squeegee should also be rinsed to prevent dirt build up. The vac motor should be run for several minutes afterwards to remove any moisture that could be present in the vac motor to reduce chances of corrosion that could damage the vac motor. Failure do to this maintenance could cause in a loss of vacuum airflow and increase in costly repairs.
