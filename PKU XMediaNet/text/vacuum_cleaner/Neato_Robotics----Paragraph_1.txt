Unlike the Roomba vacuum cleaner, which goes randomly around a room, the Neato robot travels in straight line patterns partially overlapped, with the help of a laser range finder that scans around in a full 360Â° circle, and the SLAM algorithm that allows it to map the room being vacuumed while it is completing its task. The Neato XV robot is able to return to its home base and charge itself when running out of energy, and has sensors that prevent it from falling off stairs. In case the robot is used in a floorplan larger than it can cover with one battery charge, the robot is able to continue cleaning at the exact spot where it left off the previous session, after recharging its batteries.
