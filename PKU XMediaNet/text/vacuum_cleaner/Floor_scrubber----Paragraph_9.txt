When floor scrubbing machines became more available to many types of facilities, there was a need to cover a different type of flooring. Floor buffers were invented to scrub and polish the floor with linoleum surface. The machines use rotary brushes with soft material to clean and make the floor shine. For marble and wood floors, floor polishers may be used to apply protective coating to floor.
