Central vacuum systems require periodic emptying of the dirt canister or replacing the filter bag, typically 2â€“4 times per year. In some models, it is also important that the filters be changed frequently, especially for designs where the just-filtered air passes through the motor for cooling. For filtered systems, the bag may need to be replaced long before it is filled to its nominal capacity, because of reduced suction due to clogging with dirt or fine dust.
