The chief disadvantage of central vacuums is higher initial cost. In the United States, the average central vacuum system has an installed cost of around $1000. This initial expense must be weighed against the long-term benefits of a central vacuum, including the typical longer service life of the equipment, and negligible consumables cost if a filterless system is chosen.
