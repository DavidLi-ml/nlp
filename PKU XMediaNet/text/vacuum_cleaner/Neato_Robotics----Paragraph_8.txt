XV-21 and XV-25 models were reported in early 2013 having an improved air exhaust directed upwards (though through side located vents), instead of sideways, to reduce disturbance of room dust before it can be vacuumed up. Internal electronics improvements included stronger cabling between the LCD display panel and the main PC board, but eliminated a hidden RS232 serial interface inside the machine; only the external USB interface for firmware updates and troubleshooting remained. Electronics hobbyists had been using the internal serial connection for various radio control devices not compatible with USB interfaces.
