Vacuuming is performed in the same manner as with a portable machine. Sometimes, the higher vacuum power of central vacuum may require reduction (for example, when cleaning a delicate sheer fabric curtain). Excess vacuum is "bled off" by partially opening a bleed port or slot to let some intake air bypass the cleaning tool. The bleed port is typically located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, to allow quick adjustment during use.
