In 2014, Dyson announced its comeback to the robotic vacuum industry with the Dyson 360 Eye. The 360 refers to a 360 degree camera that is mounted on the robot and is supposed to provide a better orientation while cleaning. This is a different approach to navigation and path finding compared to products from Neato Robotics or iRobot. The robot vacuum was scheduled for a Japan-only release in spring 2015 but international launches were expected to follow later in the year.
