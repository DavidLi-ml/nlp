In 2004 a British company released Airider, a hovering vacuum cleaner that floats on a cushion of air. It has claimed to be light-weight and easier to maneuver (compared to using wheels), although it is not the first vacuum cleaner to do this â€” the Hoover Constellation predated it by at least 35 years.
