A hataki (叩き) is a type of household cleaning tool that originated in Japan. Consisting of durable cloth strips attached to a stick or pole, it is used for moving dust from surfaces onto the floor, where it can be swept or vacuumed. Similar to a feather duster, it is not to be confused with an Ōnusa.
