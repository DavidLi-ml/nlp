One fire that had a major impact on the foundation of the drills was a fire at the private Catholic school Our Lady of the Angels in 1958, in Chicago, Illinois. Children on the second floor were trapped there, with neither the teachers nor their students knowing how to get out of the building safely. Many children tried jumping out the window and many burned in the fire. The main cause of death was of being trapped in the building without an exit. Although the school had passed a fire inspection two months prior, having the correct amount of fire exits and fire extinguishers for that time, it lacked smoke detectors or adequate fire alarms and was overcrowded.
