For works that present a particular challenge for certain sections (e.g., a complex, exposed passage for the viola section), orchestras may have section rehearsals or sectionals in which a section of the orchestra (e.g., the woodwind players or the double basses) rehearse on their own under the direction of the principal player in the section, or, in some cases, also with the conductor (e.g., in the case of a very rhythmically challenging piece).
