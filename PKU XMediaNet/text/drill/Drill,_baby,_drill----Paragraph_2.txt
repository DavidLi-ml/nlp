One possible source of the expression "Drill, baby, drill" was a similar three-word expression used by Bill Epton, an African American radical, whose three word statement "Burn, baby, burn" in 1964 led to him being "the first person convicted of criminal anarchy since the Red Scare of 1919". Another possible explanation of the origin is that Erik Rush or some predecessor modeled the phrase after the title of the 1966 Mario Bava film Operazione paura which was released in the USA under the colorful title Kill, Baby, Kill and also known as Kill, Baby... Kill! The 1973 Ray Austin film House of the Living Dead also used this same title Kill, Baby, Kill when released in USA video format, although this latter film achieved little of the popularity of the earlier Bava film. Another possibility is that it is a play on the "Burn Baby Burn" lyrics of the song "Disco Inferno."
