The conductor leads orchestra rehearsals. She calls out bar numbers or rehearsal letters to direct the orchestra to different sections which she would like to perform. While classical conductors do not typically speak to direct the orchestra during concerts, during rehearsals, the conductor speaks to the orchestra to communicate her artistic vision for the piece and to explain the "articulation" (note lengths), tone colours and tempos she would like to use. During initial rehearsals, the conductor frequently stops the rehearsal to ask players or sections to change the way they are playing or provide guidance to the orchestra. For a choir, the choral conductor will lead rehearsals. In cases where a choir is preparing a piece which will be sung with orchestra, the initial rehearsals may be led by the choir's own choir conductor, and the rehearsals before the concert may be led by the orchestra conductor.
