More advanced power units, usually labeled rotary hammers, tend to be larger and provide a bigger impact force by utilizing a technology called the "electro-pneumatic" (EP) hammering mechanism," because it is powered directly by electricity, instead of a separate air compressor. An EP hammer has two pistonsâ€”a drive piston, and a flying piston. An electric motor turns a crank, which moves the drive piston back and forth in a cylinder. The flying piston is at the other end of the same cylinder. The pistons do not actually touch, but the air pressure in the EP cylinder allows for a much more efficient transfer of hammering energy than springs in the cam-action style tools. The majority of modern rotary hammers as well as all electric-powered chipping guns or jack-hammers all utilize this EP technology. Modern units allow the hammer and rotation functions to be used separately or in combination, i.e., hammer mode, drill mode, or both. When used in the hammer mode, the tool provides a drilling function similar to a jackhammer.
