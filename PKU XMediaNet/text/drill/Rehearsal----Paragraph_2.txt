Rehearsals of small groups of performers, such as small rock bands, jazz quartets or organ trios may be held without a leader; in these cases, the performers themselves jointly determine how to run the rehearsal, which songs to practice, and so on. Some small groups may have their rehearsals led by a bandleader. Almost all mid- to large group performances have a person who leads the rehearsals; this person may be a bandleader in a rock, country or jazz setting; a conductor in classical music (including in opera); a director in theatre or musical theatre; or a film director for movie rehearsals.
