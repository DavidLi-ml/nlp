Prior to rehearsing a concerto with an orchestra, a soloist will rehearse it with a pianist substituting for the parts played by the entire orchestra (thus, two pianists in the case of piano concerti, or a violin soloist and a pianist in preparation for a violin concerto). To help with tempo in orchestra, solo or chamber rehearsals, a metronome may be used to sound out the tempo prior to the commencement of a piece. For music performances, a dress rehearsal does not imply dressing in performance concert dress. It is a final rehearsal before performance where generally the ensemble will run through the entire program as if there is an audience. In some orchestras, there may be a limited audience during the dress rehearsal (typically university music students or other invited guests).
