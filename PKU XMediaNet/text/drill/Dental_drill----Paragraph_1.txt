Modern dental drills can rotate at up to 400,000 rpm, and generally use hard metal alloy bits known as burrs. Dental burrs come in a great variety of shapes designed for specific applications. They are often made of steel with a tungsten carbide coating, or of tungsten carbide entirely. The burr may also have a diamond coating.
