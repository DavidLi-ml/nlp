Lower power units are usually called "hammer drills," typically have a "cam-action" or "percussion" hammering mechanism, in which two sets of toothed gears mechanically interact with each other to hammer while rotating the drill bit. With "cam-action" drills, the chuck has a mechanism whereby the entire chuck and bit move forward and backwards on the axis of rotation, the motion is tied to the rotation of the chuck. This type of drill is often used with and without the hammer action but it is not possible to use the hammer action alone as it is the rotation over the "cams" which causes the hammer motion. These units are usually smaller and are commonly powered by cordless technology. They are not typically used for production construction drilling, but rather for occasional drilling of concrete or masonry.
