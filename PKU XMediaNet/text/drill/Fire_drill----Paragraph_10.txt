The New Zealand Fire Service requires all schools and educational facilities to carry out a fire drill (termed a trial evacuation) at least once every six months, unless a shorter period is specified in the school's approved evacuation scheme. Schools need to give the Fire Service 7-10 working days' notice before a fire drill is planned, and must submit a report to the Fire Service within 7-10 working days of the drill; an unplanned alarm activation does not count as a fire drill.
