In the NFL, some team owners and coaches do not allow the Oklahoma drill. Notable exceptions include the Chargers, and the Bengals who use the drill as a kind of celebration of the first day of full-contact practices. Veterans and high-profile NFL players rarely participate in pit drills owing to the higher risk of injury. One of the last holdouts, the Jaguars last ran the Oklahoma drill in the 2011 training camp under former head coach Jack Del Rio. On October 7, 2015, Dan Campbell reportedly used the Oklahoma drill to begin his first practice as interim head coach of the Miami Dolphins.
