The dress rehearsal is a full-scale rehearsal where the actors and/or musicians perform every detail of the performance. For theatre, cast members wear their costumes, and the backdrop may be used with props. For a musical performance, the dress rehearsal does not require wearing formal concert outfits (e.g., tuxedos and gowns). In music, the dress rehearsal is the final rehearsal before the performance. In music, while initial rehearsals will often involve working on challenging sections of the piece or pieces, during the dress rehearsal, the entire piece (or pieces) are typically played in their entirety.
