The three-cone drill, or 3-cone drill is a test performed by American football athletes at the NFL combine. It is primarily run to evaluate the agility ayers by scouts, particularly for the NFL draft but also for collegiate recruiting. While not as highly regarded a test as the 40 yard dash, it is still an important barometer used by NFL personnel to compare players.
