The purpose of fire drills in schools is so that everyone in the building is aware of how to exit the building in the quickest, easiest and safest way possible if a fire, smoke, carbon monoxide or other emergency did occur and will help staff and students familiarise with the sound of the fire alarm. Fire drills were put in place after many severe fires in schools happened.
