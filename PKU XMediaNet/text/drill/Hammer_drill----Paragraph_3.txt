Hammer drills of both working principles are well suited for drilling holes in masonry or stone. They are also both used to drill holes in concrete footings to pin concrete wall forms and to drill holes in concrete floors to pin wall framing. Larger rotary hammers can also be used for "doweling" (repetitive drilling of large rebar anchor holes), and through-holes in concrete and masonry walls. The hammering action helps to break up the masonry so that it can be removed by the drill bit's flutes.
