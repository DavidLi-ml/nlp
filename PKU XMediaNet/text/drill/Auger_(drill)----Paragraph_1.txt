An auger used for digging post holes is called an 'earth auger', 'handheld power earth drill', 'soil auger', or 'mechanized post hole digger'. This kind of auger can be a manually turned, handheld device, or powered by an electric motor or internal-combustion engine, possibly attached to a tractor (being provided with power by the tractor engine's power take-off as shown). Handheld augers can also be used for making holes for garden planting.
