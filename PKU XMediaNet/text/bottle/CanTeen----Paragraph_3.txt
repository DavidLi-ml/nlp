CanTeen helps young people cope with cancer in their family. Through CanTeen, they learn to explore and deal with their feelings about cancer, connect with other young people in the same boat and if theyâ€™ve been diagnosed themselves, CanTeen also provides specialist, youth-specific treatment teams. By feeling understood and supported, young people develop resilience and can rebuild the foundations that crumbled beneath them when cancer turned their life upside down. CanTeen works by having young people at the centre of everything they do. They were set up by a group of young cancer patients in 1985 and still have young people affected by cancer guiding the organisation at every level.
