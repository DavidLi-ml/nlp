On the last Friday of October, CanTeen hold National Bandanna Day (NBD) where Bandannas are sold to fundraise. National Bandanna Day is CanTeenâ€™s largest fundraiser and this year (2015) it will be held on Friday 30 October. They're aiming to raise $1.25 million to support young people living with cancer. Every year, another 23,000 young people (63 a day) have to deal with the challenge of cancer. Bandannas play a significant role as a symbol of hope and empowerment for people who are affected by cancer and are worn during their cancer journey.
