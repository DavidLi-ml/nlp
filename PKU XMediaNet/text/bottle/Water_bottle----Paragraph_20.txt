All disposable water bottles and most multi-use water bottles are recyclable. Water bottles made of glass, aluminium and steel are the most readily recyclable. HDPE and LDPE bottles can be recycled as well. To determine if a plastic water bottle can be recycled, locate the SPI code on the bottle (usually on the bottom of the bottle inside what appears to be a 'recycling' triangle) and dispose of the bottle accordingly. You can also check with the manufacturer. Recycling helps to lower the impact of certain products on the environment.
