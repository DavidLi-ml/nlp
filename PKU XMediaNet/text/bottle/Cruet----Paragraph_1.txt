Cruets today typically serve a culinary function, holding liquid condiments such as olive oil and balsamic vinegar. They often have a filter built into them to act as a strainer, so that vinegar containing herbs and other solid ingredients will pour clear. Cruets also serve as decanters for lemon juice and other oils. They are also used for the serving of the wine and water in a Catholic mass. In Canada and the UK a small cruet can also hold previously ground salt or pepper, according to Merriam-Webster sources.
