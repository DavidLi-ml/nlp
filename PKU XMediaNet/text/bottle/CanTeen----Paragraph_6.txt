CanTeen’s specially trained counsellors give young people a safe space to talk about difficult thoughts and feelings and help them develop coping strategies. Sadness, anxiety and grief don’t stick to business hours so neither do CanTeen. Online and phone counselling is available seven days a week. Or you can also meet a counsellor face to face.
