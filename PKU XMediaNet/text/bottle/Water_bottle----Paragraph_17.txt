Much of the plastic that can be traced to health risks is latent in disease epidemiology and outcomes often appear months or years later. William Shotyk has performed two studies concerning contamination and leaching in PET containers in storage capacities. One study was undertaken to research the notion of “storage dose” of water in acid-cleaned LDPE bottles. Compared to that of PET bottles indicated after three months of storage at room temperature, the water in the PET bottle yielded nearly 200 percent more of the Sb chemical concentration. This study provides insight on the storage capacity of the water contained in PET bottles and elevates the need to regularly use and replace water stored for emergencies in such bottle types. It is important to read the expiration date of the bottles and dispose of water that has been stored under conditions that increase potentially hazardous chemical leeching.
