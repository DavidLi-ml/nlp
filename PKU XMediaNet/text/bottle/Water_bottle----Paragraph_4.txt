Multi-use water bottles can be made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), copolyester or polypropylene. All offer the advantage of being durable, lightweight, dishwasher-safe and BPA-free. The main difference between each type of water bottle is the flexibility of the material. Copolyester and polypropylene bottles offer the greatest rigidity. HDPE bottles retain some flexibility, while LDPE bottles (most commonly associated with 'squeeze' type bottles) are highly flexible and collapsible.
