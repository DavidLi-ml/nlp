Water bottle sales have increased almost every year in the United States for more than a decade. In 2011, greater than $11 billion was spent on U.S. bottled water products. The International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) states that Americans are increasingly relying on water bottles for convenience and portability. Plastic bottles are inexpensive, transparent and shatter resistant.
