A study conducted by engineering science students at Loyola College in Maryland suggested that the liquid content of aluminium bottles stays slightly colder than the liquid content of glass bottles when allowed to warm at room temperature. These results were not corroborated by a 2005 study at Bucknell University, which found that “the fluid in the aluminium bottle cools much faster than the glass bottle, and once removed from a cold source and exposed to room temperature, the glass bottle remained cooler longer than the aluminium bottle.” This conclusion is consistent with the fact that the bulk thermal conductivity of aluminium (237 W/(m·K)) is significantly higher than that of glass (1.1 W/(m·K)), as well as the fact that aluminium bottles are significantly thinner than glass. While the glass versus aluminium debate may make sense in connection with beer bottles, soft drinks are another matter. The majority of those bottles are currently plastic, while most beer bottles are glass.
