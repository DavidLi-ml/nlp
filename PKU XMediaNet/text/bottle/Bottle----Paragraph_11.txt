The plastic is strain oriented in the stretch blow molding manufacturing process. Plastic bottles are typically used to store liquids such as water, soft drinks, motor oil, cooking oil, medicine, shampoo, milk, and ink. The size ranges from very small sample bottles to large carboys. The main advantage that plastic bottles have over glass is their superior resistance to breakage, in both production and transportation. But, at the same time, they are non-degraded and cause environmental problems.
