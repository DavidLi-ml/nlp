Chemicals used for making some types of bottles have been shown to be detrimental to the health of humans. Inhalation of plastic is an enormous hazard for the factory workers who handle the material. In many developing countries plastic waste is burned rather than recycled or deposited in landfills. Rural residents of developing countries who burn plastic as a disposal method are not protected from the chemical inhalation hazards associated with this practice. Inhalation of the pollutants produced from burning plastics have been shown to result in poor health outcomes.
