Metal water bottles are growing in popularity. Made primarily from stainless steel or aluminum, they are durable and retain minimal odor or taste from previous contents. Aluminum bottles contain a plastic resin or epoxy liner to protect contents from taste and odor transfer. Although most liners are now BPA free, older and less expensive models can contain BPA.
