A beer bottle is a bottle made to contain beer, usually made of glass and comes in various sizes, shapes and colours (usually brown or green). Dark amber or brown glass greatly reduces the presence of UV light, a contributing factor of spoilage for craft beers using leaf hops. However, lighter-colored bottles are often used for marketing reasons.
