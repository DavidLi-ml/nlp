Carboys come in various volumes ranging from 3.8 to 24.7 L (1.0 to 6.5 US gal). The term carboy itself usually refers to a 19 L (5.0 US gal) carboy, unless otherwise noted. A 4.5 L (1.2 US gal) carboy is usually called a jug. A 57 L (15 US gal) carboy is usually called a demijohn (in the Philippines, dama juana.)
