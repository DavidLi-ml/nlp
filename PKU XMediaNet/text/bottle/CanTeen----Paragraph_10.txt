CanTeen is passionate about empowerment and is proud to have young people providing direction and advice at all levels of the organisation, including the Board of Directors. Being a Member-led organisation ensures that every aspect of CanTeen’s work is informed by young people so that they get the services, programs and information right. Any young person that receives support from CanTeen can put themselves forward to participate in the organisation’s governance structure. Each local CanTeen Division has a committee that meets regularly to oversee the planning of programs and activities within the Division. Young people hold the majority of positions on those committees. Each Division also elects one Member to sit on the Member Advisory Council and advise the Board.
