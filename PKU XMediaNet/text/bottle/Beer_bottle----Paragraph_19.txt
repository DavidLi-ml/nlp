In the United States, the size of these bottles is usually 7 U.S. fl oz (207 ml), and are similar to the size of original Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola bottles. The term pony dates to the 19th century, and is due to the diminutive size, being used earlier for a pony glass, and similarly for a pony keg. The best-known brands of ponies are Rolling Rock (pony introduced 1939?) and Miller High Life (pony introduced 1972), and the 7 oz size of Rolling Rock likely contributed to the standardization on this size. Other major brands (Budweiser, Coors, Miller) are also regionally available in 7 oz bottles; these were introduced in the early 1970s, around the time of Miller High Life being so-packaged. More recently, Bud Light Lime has started to be sold in ponies, called "Limeys".
