Cicadetta, in North America colloquially known as the "small grass cicadas", is a genus of generally small-bodied annual cicadas widespread across portions of the Nearctic, Palearctic, Oriental, and Ethiopian ecozones. In older scientific and taxonomic literature, this genus was popularly referred to as Melampsalta. These cicadas occur in a diverse spectrum of habitats, although most taxa are typically associated with weedy meadows and tallgrass prairie ecosystems.
