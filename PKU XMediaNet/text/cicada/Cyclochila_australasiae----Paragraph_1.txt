Cyclochila australasiae was formerly commonly known as the Great Green Cicada; in addition, the various colour forms have different vernacular names, including yellow Monday for a common yellow morph; Chocolate Soldier for a rare dark tan form; and Blue Moon for a rare turquoise form. The names for the green and yellow forms have been recorded since at least 1896. Walter Wilson Froggatt reported that the green form was known as green Monday (alongside yellow Monday for the yellow form) in his 1907 work Australian Insects.
