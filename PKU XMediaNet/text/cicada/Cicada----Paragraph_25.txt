Cicadas, like other Auchenorrhyncha, are adapted for jumping (saltation), as well as the usual insect modes of locomotion, walking and flight. However, they do not walk or run well, and take to the wing to travel distances greater than a few centimetres. Cicadas can extend their hind legs in under a millisecond to execute a jump, implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.
