The nymphs emerge on a spring evening when the soil temperature at about 20 cm (8 in) depth is above 17.9 °C (64 °F). In most years in the United States, this works out to late April or early May in the far south, and late May to early June in the far north. Emerging nymphs climb to a suitable place on the nearby vegetation to complete their transformation into adults. They molt one last time and then spend about six days in the leaves waiting for their exoskeletons to harden completely. Just after this final molt, the teneral adults are white, but darken within an hour.
