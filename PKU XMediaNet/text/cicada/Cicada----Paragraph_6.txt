Most of the North American species are in the genus Neotibicen: the annual or jar fly or dog-day cicadas (so named because they emerge in late July and August). The best-known North American genus, however, is Magicicada. These periodical cicadas have an extremely long lifecycle of 13 or 17 years, suddenly and briefly emerging in large numbers.
