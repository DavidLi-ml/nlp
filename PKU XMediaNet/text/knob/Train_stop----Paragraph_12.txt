A fixed train stop that is the last one on a running line in the reverse direction may, despite its name, be suppressed, as is the case with the associated "Fixed Signals" on the Sydney network. Suppression is needed because in Sydney, the rear trip cock on a train is always lowered, while in Melbourne, by contrast, suppression is not required because the trip cock at the rear of a train is always raised clear of any wayside trip arm.
