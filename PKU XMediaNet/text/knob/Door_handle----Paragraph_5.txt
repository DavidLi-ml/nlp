In Europe door levers are more common than the door knob, while in the US, door knobs are traditionally preferred over door levers. However door knobs can be difficult for the young and elderly to operate. For this reason, door handles in most American commercial and industrial buildings and in many households use a lever-operated handle, rather than a knob, as the lever does not require a tight grip. Levers are also beneficial on doors with narrow stile widths where the reduced backset leaves insufficient space to comfortably turn a door knob.
