The sounding length of a mutation stop gives the answer as to what pitch the rank sounds. For example, a stop labeled 22⁄3' (or one-third of 8') sounds at three times the frequency, that is, the interval of a twelfth above unison pitch. This third harmonic (twelfth, quint, qvinta, rorkvint, or nazard [nasard]) is the most-common pitch, followed by the fifth harmonic (tierce [terz or ters on some organs]) (13⁄5') and sixth (larigot, nasat) (11⁄3') and there are rarer examples from higher in the series, such as the "septième" or "septima" (11⁄7') and "none" (8⁄9').
