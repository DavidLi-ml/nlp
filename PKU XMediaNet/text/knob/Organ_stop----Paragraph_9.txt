The term unification refers to the practice of expanding the tonal resources of an organ without adding extra pipes by making notes available to different stops from the same rank of pipes. For example, an 8' Gedeckt may also be made available as a 4' Gedeckt, either on the same or on a different manual. Borrowing or duplexing refers to one rank being made available from more than one stop knob, often on different manuals or pedal. Extension refers to the addition of extra pipes to the high and/or low ends of a rank in order to allow that rank to be borrowed by higher and/or lower stops. Unification and borrowing (duplexing) is mostly related to pipe organs with physical pipes; however, some (older) electronic organs also used unification and duplexing to expand the tonal resources of a limited number of synthesized virtual ranks.
