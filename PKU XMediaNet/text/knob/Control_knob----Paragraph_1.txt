Such knobs vary greatly in form, but as a rule they are expected to be grasped by the fingertips. By convention a clockwise rotation ordinarily produces an "increased" input, whatever that is understood to be. Knobs may turn continuously or may have detents to produce discrete selections; they commonly have a scale with a pointer to aid achievement of the desired setting, though it is common for the gradations in the scale to have no concrete meaning (e.g. the markings of a volume control). There is frequently a fixed "off" position at the origin of movement in which the knob actuates a switch shutting down whatever behavior is controlled, rather than having a separate on/off switch.
