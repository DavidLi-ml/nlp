The Train stops at the Berlin S-Bahn were first installed in the late 1920s. They are named Bernauer Fahrsperre (or Fahrsperre Bauart Bernau) because of their testing and first installation on the Stettin Railway to the suburban town of Bernau. This was the first heavy rail rapid transit system with third-rail electrification in Germany. They are being phased out in favour of the ZBS system based on Eurobalises until 2025.
