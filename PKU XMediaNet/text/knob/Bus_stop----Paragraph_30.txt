Some nursing homes have built fake, imitation bus stops for their residents who have dementia. Some of these bus stops are even fitted with outdated advertisements and timetables â€“ 30 years outdated. The residents will sit at the bus stop waiting for a bus to take them to their imagined destination. After some time, a staff member comes to escort the clients back to the home.
