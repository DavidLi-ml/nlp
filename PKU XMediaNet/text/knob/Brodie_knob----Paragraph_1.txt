The device is a small, independently rotating knob (similar to a U.S. classic door knob) facing the driver that is securely mounted on the outside rim of a steering wheel. The protruding knob is an aftermarket accessory. The free rotation is intended to help make steering with one hand less difficult or faster. The Brodie name is a reference to Steve Brodie and was meant to describe all manner of reckless stunts. The device is often called a "suicide knob" because it is useless and even interferes in controlling the wheel during an emergency. Brodie knobs are also known as "necker knobs", because they allow steering with one hand while necking with the passenger. It is also called a "knuckle buster" because of the disadvantage posed by the knob when letting go of the steering wheel after going around a corner, the wheel spins rapidly and the knob can hit the user's knuckle, forearm, or elbow. If the driver is wearing a long sleeve shirt, the protruding accessory on the rim of the steering wheel can also become caught in the sleeve's open cut by the button. Other names include "granny knob" and "wheel spinner."
