An invention called the "Bach bow" with an arched back uses a system of levers to slacken or tighten bow hair immediately while playing so as to (according to its advocates) facilitate the performance of polyphonic music. Such a bow was conceived early in the 20th century by Arnold Schering and Albert Schweitzer and constructed by Rolf Schröder in 1933. A similar device called the "Vega bow" was built in 1954 under the sponsorship of the violinist Emil Telmányi. Neither of these bows bears any particular relation to historical Baroque bows and neither has ever been widely employed.
