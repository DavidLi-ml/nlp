While unification, borrowing (duplexing) and extension increase the tonal resources and flexibility of the organ, the downside is that greater care needs to be taken by the organist in registering the organ, particularly when the composition requires many notes to sound at the same time. Because stops at multiple pitch levels or from multiple coupled divisions may be engaged at the same time for the same note, it is possible for these stops to interact in unexpected ways when more than one note sounds at the same time, as in a chord. Playing with full registration (all the stops out) on an organ that is heavily unified and duplexed may result in an occasional chord that sounds thinner or that emphasizes higher harmonics more on some notes than on others. Part of an organist's training is to detect unification and duplexing and to create registrations that take unification and duplexing into account.
