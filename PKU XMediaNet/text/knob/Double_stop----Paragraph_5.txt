In longer three-note or four-note chords, either the top note or the top two notes are sustained after the lower notes have been played as grace notes. Sometimes the noteheads for the lower notes are filled in to show they are of short duration while the noteheads for the notes to be held are left open. This notation occurs, for example, at the beginning of the fourth movement of Beethoven's fifth symphony.
