In the past there were a number of producers of Dorset knobs. Today the only firm to produce them commercially is Moores Biscuits of Morcombelake four miles west of Bridport in the west of the county of Dorset in England. The Moore family have baked biscuits in Dorset since before 1860. The bakery was established in 1880 by Samuel Moore and manufactures a variety of traditional biscuits in addition to the Dorset knob. Dorset knobs are only produced during the months of January and February. They are normally sold in a distinctive and traditional tin.
