Modern passenger information systems and journey planners require a detailed digital representation of the stops and transportation hubs. The CEN Transmodel data model, and the related IFOPT data interchange standard, define how transport systems, including bus stops, should be described for use in computer models. In Transmodel, a single bus stop is modeled as a "Stop Point", and a grouping of nearby bus stops as a "Stop Area" or "Stop Place". The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) standard, originally developed by Google, defines a simple and widely used data interchange standard for public transport schedules. GTFS also includes a table of Stop Points which gives a name, identifier, and location for each bus stop. OpenStreetMap has a modeling standard for bus stops.
