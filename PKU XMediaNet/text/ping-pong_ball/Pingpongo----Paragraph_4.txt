Pingpongo has no regulations for the size of the table or net. There is only a recommendation that a table, or tables, (neither too big, nor small) that allow the game to develop normally be used, and, if possible, that they have a certain irregularity that makes the game more unpredictable, but affects the players equally. In the official tournaments matches were played on conventional table tennis tables, and on groups of tables, or boards propped on trestles.
