The most common serve is the same as in table tennis where the ball must bounce first in the server’s side of the table and then on the receiver’s one. A mistake in service gives a point to the opponent, this can happen when the ball hits the net, bounces on the server’s court or on one of the server’s obstacles and does not pass onto the opponent’s court, or if it does not bounce on the opponent’s court. If the ball touches the net upon service and passes onto the opponent’s court, service shall be done again. .
