Official special tournaments must count with the presence and/or participation of at least one member of the PPOB and have to previously be coordinated with the PPOB. They must have a minimum of 8 participants and provide points for the “Historical” and “biennial” global rankings in accordance with the number of participants as the classification system indicate.
