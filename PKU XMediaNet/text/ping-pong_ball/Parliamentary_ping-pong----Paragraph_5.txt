Usually the time limit is imposed by the end of the Parliamentary session when all business, including incomplete Bills, simply gets erased from the books and has to start again. This usually occurs at the state opening of Parliament some time in November - Parliament can continue working on the previous year right up to the night before. Another instance is just after a general election is called, when Parliament can work for a few days before it gets dissolved, and the legislation it is working on must either get completed or be thrown away.
