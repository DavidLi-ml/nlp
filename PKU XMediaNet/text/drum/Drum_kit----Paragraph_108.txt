When a drum kit is entirely miked through the sound system, the drummer may decide to use monitor speakers (called "foldback" in the UK) to hear their playing better. Some drummers use butt shakers mounted in the drum throne, rather than a powerful subwoofer to monitor their bass drum playing, because this reduces the need for loud volume onstage for the drummer. With the "butt shaker", the drummer feels the playing of the bass drum, as it is transmitted through vibrations to their posterior.
