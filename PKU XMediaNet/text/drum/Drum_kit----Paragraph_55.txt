Electronic drums are used for many purposes. Some drummers use electronic drums for playing in small venues where a very low volume for the band is desired. Since electronic drums do not create any acoustic sound, with all of the drum sounds coming from a keyboard amplifier or PA system, the volume of electronic drums can be much lower than an acoustic kit. Some drummers use electronic drums as practice instruments, because they can be listened to with headphones, enabling a drummer to practice in an apartment or in the middle of the night without disturbing others. Some drummers use electronic drums to take advantage of the huge range of sounds that modern drum modules can produce, which range from sampled sounds of real drums, cymbals and percussion instruments, to synthesized sounds.
