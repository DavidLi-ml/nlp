This type of gate has many different local names throughout the world, sometimes hinting at its rough-and-ready nature and cheap construction. The term "Hampshire gate" is widely used in Britain (both in Hampshire and elsewhere) â€“ the names of other counties are occasionally substituted, or more often that of New Zealand. In New Zealand itself it is called a Taranaki gate, while in Ireland it is known as a slap, and in Australia as a cocky's gate, Bogan gate, running gate, machinery gate or Queensland gate. In the United States it is simply called a wire gate. Though the origins of the gate are obscure, the name Taranaki Gate is believed to reflect the location of its first widespread use; it may well have been invented independently in several places.
