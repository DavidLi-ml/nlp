Florida's Turnpike Enterprise plans to convert the entire Turnpike to an all electronic toll road, like the HEFT. Work to convert the section of the Turnpike mainline between I-595 and Lantana is planned to begin in 2018. The project also includes several road and interchange improvements along that stretch of the Turnpike.
