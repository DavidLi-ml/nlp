In the context of a multi-microphone recording session, noise gating is employed to reduce the leakage of sound into a microphone from sources other than the one the microphone was intended for. One example involves the mic-ing up of a drumkit. In most multi-mic drum recordings one microphone will be used to capture the snare drum sound and another to capture the kick drum sound. The snare microphone will output a signal composed of a high level snare signal and a lower level kick drum signal (due to the further distance of the kick drum from the snare microphone). If the threshold level of the noise gate is set correctly a snare drum signal can be isolated. To fully isolate the snare drum signal the release rate has to be quite fast which can cause the tail end of the snare sound to be 'chopped off'. This can usually be remedied by the inclusion of one or more overhead microphone, which can act as a general 'audio glue' for all the other gated sources.
