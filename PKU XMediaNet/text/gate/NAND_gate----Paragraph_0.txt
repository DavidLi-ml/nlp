In digital electronics, a NAND gate (negative-AND) is a logic gate which produces an output which is false only if all its inputs are true; thus its output is complement to that of the AND gate. A LOW (0) output results only if both the inputs to the gate are HIGH (1); if one or both inputs are LOW (0), a HIGH (1) output results. It is made using transistors and junction diodes. By De Morgan's theorem, AB=A+B, and thus a NAND gate is equivalent to inverters followed by an OR gate.
