This method tends to be most useful on long lenses and zoom lenses, especially when larger lenses may be difficult to take on and off again quickly. The aperture is fully opened, with the shutter opened, focus set to infinity, and if a zoom, zoomed in as tight as possible. The lens itself acts as a large magnifying glass for the focus puller, who only needs to position the flashlight and his line of sight properly to scan the gate.
