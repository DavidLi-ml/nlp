The improvements also came with a series of toll hikes between 1989 and 1993 to make the toll rates more uniform six cents per mile (3.7 Â¢/km) throughout the turnpike's length. The first one was enacted on April 1, 1989, which raised the rate to $9.95. The second one, on July 1, 1991, affected only the section north of Lantana, raising the trip's cost to $12.35. The last one took effect on July 11, 1993, increasing the trip's cost to $14.40.
