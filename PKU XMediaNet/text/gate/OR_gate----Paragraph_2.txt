OR Gates are basic logic gates, and as such they are available in TTL and CMOS ICs logic families. The standard 4000 series CMOS IC is the 4071, which includes four independent two-input OR gates. The traditional TTL version is the 7432. There are many offshoots of the original 7432 OR gate. All have the same pinout but different internal architecture, allowing them to operate in different voltage ranges and/or at higher speeds. In addition to the standard 2-Input OR Gate, 3- and 4-Input OR Gates are also available. In the CMOS series, these are:
