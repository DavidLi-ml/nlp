The operation of Sunshine State Parkway gas stations and service centers were originally bid out under separate contracts, and as a result, differing petroleum brands operated concurrently along the Parkway, with varying levels of service and pricing. This practice was discontinued in 1995 when all service center operations were combined to improve supply and continuity of service; with Martin Petroleum, a Florida Corporation, operating the stations with Citgo brand fuel at its stations. Since then, the Venezuelan government, under President Hugo Ch√°vez, nationalized Citgo, and in 2006, political controversy resulted in a movement to remove the brand from the turnpike. Currently, the gas stations are under the Shell Brand.
