North of the SR 70 interchange, the Turnpike enters a rural area, with cattle farms and orange groves lining the road for most of the section between Fort Pierce and Kissimmee, with only one interchange with SR 60 in Yeehaw Junction (exit 193), although there are two service plazas in this area, one at Fort Drum at mile marker 184 and the other, Canoe Creek, at mile marker 229. Between Fort Pierce and Yeehaw Junction, the turnpike travels in a nearly east-west direction heading inland, with a 40.5 miles (65.2 km) gap between the two exits, the second longest of any US expressway. Between Yeehaw Junction and Kissimmee, the turnpike, returning to a north-northwest direction towards Orlando, has a 48.9 miles (78.7 km) (47 miles (76 km) southbound) stretch without an exit, the longest of any US expressway. At mile marker 236, the ticket system ends at the Three Lakes toll plaza, as the turnpike enters the Orlando Area and development starts to reappear on the turnpike. The SunPass only interchange located at Kissimmee Park Road, a partial interchange featuring a northbound on- and southbound off-ramp only, is named for Senator N. Ray Carroll, longtime Osceola County banker, citrus grower and cattle rancher. After interchanges with US 192/US 441 (exit 242 northbound, exit 244 southbound) and the Osceola Parkway (exit 249), it enters Orange County, and Orlando. Exit 251 features a partial interchange with SR 417 (Central Florida GreeneWay), with an exit from the northbound Turnpike to northbound SR 417 and entrance from southbound SR 417 to southbound Turnpike. Exit 254 is a massive interchange with both Orange Blossom Trail and the Beachline Expressway, where the Turnpike expands to eight lanes north of the interchange, and then it intersects with Consulate Drive (exit 255), a southbound only, SunPass only interchange.
