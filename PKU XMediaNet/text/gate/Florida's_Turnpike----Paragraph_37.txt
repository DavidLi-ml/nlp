A study is currently under way to eventually reconstruct the northern end of the Turnpike at its junction with Interstate 75 to improve the traffic merge pattern between I-75 and State Road 44, with congestion and some drivers suddenly changing lanes on I-75 between the Turnpike junction and SR 44 a major issue in the area. The project is not scheduled for construction funding until 2015.
