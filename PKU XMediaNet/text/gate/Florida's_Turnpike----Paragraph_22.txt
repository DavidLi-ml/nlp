From its opening in January 1957 to April 12, 1968, the road was known as the Sunshine State Parkway (SSP). On April 12, 1968, the road was renamed to its current name of Florida's Turnpike, to identify that the toll road was located in Florida and to avoid confusion from other Florida landmarks such as the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. The Sunshine State Parkway moniker was commonly used for the next decade and remnants of the name can be seen on several Turnpike maintenance buildings.
