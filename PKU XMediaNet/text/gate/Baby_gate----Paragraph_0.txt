A baby gate or child safety gate is a protective barrier designed to prevent babies and toddlers from accessing areas of a home where they might be unsafe, such as stairways and kitchens. Baby gates are typically constructed of metal, plastic and/or wood, and can be expanded to fit in a range of doorway widths. They may be designed for use indoors or out, and may be either hardware or pressure-mounted.
