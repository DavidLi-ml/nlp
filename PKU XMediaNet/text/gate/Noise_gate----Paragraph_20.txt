Envelope following (also called trance gating because of its prevalence in trance) is the use of a gate on a track additional to the one it attenuates, so called because the latter's amplitude profile will then match or closely follow that of the first. Envelope following may be used to create syncopated rhythms or to tighten sloppy performances. For example, a synth pad may play whole notes while keyed to a guitar or percussion part. Examples include DJ Nexus's "Journey Into Trance" (1:11), Le Chic's "Everybody Dance", and Diana Ross's "Upside Down".
