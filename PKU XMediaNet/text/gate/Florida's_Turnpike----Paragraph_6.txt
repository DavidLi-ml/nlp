At mile marker 299, the turnpike passes through the final service plaza, the Okahumpka service plaza. Between US 301 (exit 304) and the northern terminus (mile 309) is considered to be a free movement as there is no toll for anyone traveling within this section. The tollway ends with an interchange with I-75 in Wildwood, about 20 miles south of Ocala. Exit 304 provides access to southbound I-75 through that interstate's exit 329 while northbound I-75 travelers can access the turnpike at this exit.
