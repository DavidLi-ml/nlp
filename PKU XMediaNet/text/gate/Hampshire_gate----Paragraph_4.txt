If use is likely to be very rare (perhaps only in emergencies), the gate may be wired shut for security â€“ an emergency then only requires the cutting of the securing wire, not cutting the fence itself. When open, the Hampshire gate is folded back against the adjacent fence to avoid it becoming entangled with animals, people or machinery.
