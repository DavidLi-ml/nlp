Tolls on the turnpike are an average of 6.7 cents per mile (4.2 Â¢/km) for cars and other two-axle vehicles using SunPass. A trip on the entire turnpike (not including the Homestead Extension) would cost $20.93 with cash/Toll-by-Plate, and $16.69 with SunPass. The ticket system is operated between the Lantana and Three Lakes Barrier tolls and on a coin system south of Lantana and north of Kissimmee, with the Golden Glades toll barrier being a cashless toll gantry, similar to the HEFT. The turnpike was originally entirely on the ticket system, but due to congestion in the Miami and Orlando metro areas, a coin system was implemented in those sections of the turnpike in the 1990s. The SunPass electronic toll collection system, in use since 1999, has become the primary method of paying tolls on the turnpike, with 80% of customers using the electronic tolling as of October 2009. SunPass can be used on most Florida toll roads, and with conjunction with other electronic toll collection systems in Florida (E-Pass and LeeWay). SunPass users benefit from an average of a 25% discount on tolls and access to SunPass-only exit ramps. SunPass transponders are available at the gift shop and gas stations at all service plazas, as well as Publix and CVS/pharmacy stores statewide.
