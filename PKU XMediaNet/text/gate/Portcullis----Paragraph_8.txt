A portcullis was previously found on the British one penny coin and on the pre-decimal thrupenny bit; this has since been replaced by a section of the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom. The badge of the Canada Border Services Agency also bore a portcullis, symbolising the agency's role as "gatekeeper" of goods into Canada. It was also featured in the now-defunct HM Customs and Excise in the United Kingdom.
