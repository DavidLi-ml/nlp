The Turnpike itself is in two sections. The first is the Mainline, a 265-mile (426 km) route from the Golden Glades Interchange (north of Miami) to Wildwood that carries the hidden designation of Florida State Road 91 (SR 91), opened in stages between 1957 and 1964. The second is the 48-mile-long (77 km) Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike (HEFT) completed in 1974, that carries the hidden designation of State Road 821 (SR 821) from Florida City (near Homestead) through the suburbs to the west and north of Miami, connecting to the Mainline four miles (6 km) north of the Golden Glades Interchange. Florida's Turnpike is considered one of the busiest highways in the country (according to the IBBTA, the highway is the nation's 3rd most heavily traveled toll road).
