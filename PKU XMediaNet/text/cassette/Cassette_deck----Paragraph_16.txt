In one machine, the "Dragon", Nakamichi addressed the issue with a motor-driven automatic head alignment mechanism. This proved effective but very expensive. A later Nakamichi auto-reverse model was essentially a single-directional deck, but with an added mechanism that physically removed the cassette from the transport, flipped it over, and re-inserted it. Akai made a similar machine but doing it "flat" instead of "upright". This permitted the convenience of auto-reverse with little compromise in record or playback quality.
