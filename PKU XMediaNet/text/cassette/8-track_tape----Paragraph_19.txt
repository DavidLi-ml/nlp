Some independent artists still release eight-track tapes, such as the US band RTB2, who released We Are a Strange Man in 2011. Also, bands sometimes release eight-tracks as special releases; for example, The Melvins released a limited-time, live eight-track album, Cheap Trick issued a limited edition version of their album The Latest on the format on June 23, 2009, and power electronics solo artist Waves Crashing Piano Chords has released multiple eight-track tapes since 2012, as well as starting an eight-track tape label, H8-Track Stereo. In the book Journals, Kurt Cobain wrote about wanting to release Nirvana's album In Utero as an 8-track tape, but this never happened. Apart from a select group of highly collectible artists, the record club issues, and the quadraphonic releases, many eight-track tapes seem to have limited value to most collectors, especially if the tapes have been misused or appear to be worn.
