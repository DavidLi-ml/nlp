In stationary DCC-recorders (i.e. recorders meant for use in stereo systems), the head-assembly was usually a combination of a 9-track DCC-head with a 2-track analog stereo head, and would flip the entire head assembly around by 180 degrees when the B-side was played or recorded. In portable DCC recorders the head assembly consisted of two 9-track DCC heads (consisting of playback and recording elements depending on the model), which were in a fixed position, i.e. didn't flip around for the B-side. When playing analog cassettes, portable players would simply amplify the signal from two of the nine heads of the "other side": analog cassette recorders used the "bottom half" of the tape, while digital recordings used the "top half". Presumably the fixed assembly for portable recorders was more difficult and expensive to make but allowed for a smaller mechanism for the portable application.
