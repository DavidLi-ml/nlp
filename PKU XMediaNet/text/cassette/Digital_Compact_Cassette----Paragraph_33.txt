The DCC-Studio program used the recorder as playback and recording device, it didn't use the PC's sound card (something that not even every PC had in those days). Working with the PASC data without the need to compress and decompress it also saved a lot of hard disk space, and most computers in that time would have a hard time encoding and decoding PASC data in real-time anyway. However, many users complained that they would have liked to have the possibility of using WAV files, and Philips sent registered users a floppy disk in the mail, containing programs to convert a WAV file to PASC and vice versa. Unfortunately this conversion was extremely slow but it was later discovered that the PASC files were simply MPEG-1 Audio Layer I files that used a hardly used, hardly documented padding feature from the MPEG standard to make all frames the same length, so it was easy to convert PASC to PCM and vice versa.
