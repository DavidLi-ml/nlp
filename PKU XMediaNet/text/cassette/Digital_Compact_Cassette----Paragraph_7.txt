DCC used a Magneto-Resistive (MR) head, which was fixed to the mechanism of the player/recorder, unlike rotary heads that are used in helical scan systems such as DAT or VHS to increase head-to-tape speed. The advantages of a stationary head are clear: DCC players were extremely insensitive to shock and vibration, and compared to a mechanism based on rotary head, the DCC mechanisms were cheaper to produce. In fact, existing auto-reverse audio cassette recorder mechanisms could easily be adapted for use in DCC-recorders simply by mounting a DCC head instead of an analog stereo head.
