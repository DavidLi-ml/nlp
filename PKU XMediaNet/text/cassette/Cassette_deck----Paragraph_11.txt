The Dolby B noise reduction system was key to realizing low noise performance on slow, narrow, cassette tapes. It works by applying dynamic range compression to the high frequencies on recording, primarily boosting low-level high-frequency sounds, and corresponding expansion on playback. This lowers the high frequency noise (hiss), generally by approximately 9 dB. Enhanced versions included Dolby C (in 1980) and Dolby S types. Of the three, however, only Dolby B became common on automobile decks.
