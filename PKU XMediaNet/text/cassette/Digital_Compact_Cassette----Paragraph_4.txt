At the "HCC dagen" computer fair in Utrecht, The Netherlands, on November 24, 25 and 26, 1995, Philips presented the DCC-175 portable recorder that could be connected to an IBM-compatible PC using the "PC-link" cable. This was the first (and only) DCC recorder that could be connected to, and controlled by, a computer, and it was only ever available in the Netherlands.
