The DCC-Studio application however was a useful application that made it possible to copy audio from tape to hard disk and vice versa, edit track titles on the PC keyboard (so all lower-case and upper-case characters and symbols were available) and write them to tape all at once, edit audio by cutting and pasting fragments, and automatically record mix-tapes. The program was capable of writing the track information to the tape while it was recording the audio, which was a big advantage over the two-step process (record audio first, then edit each track title) which was involved in regular CD-to-DCC recording. Also, because a regular keyboard was used to enter track information, it was possible to enter lower-case characters and symbols that weren't available on stationary recorders.
