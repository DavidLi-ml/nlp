Because of the possibility to create new tapes with DCC-Studio, regardless of the source they were recorded from, the DCC-175/PC-Link cable/DCC-Studio combination effectively circumvented the SCMS copy protection scheme that all digital audio recording devices for consumers are supposed to have. It is possible that this raised some eyebrows in Philips' legal department, and that this is the reason why DCC-175 and PC-link were never sold outside the Netherlands.
