The "compact cassette" (a Philips trademark) was introduced by the Philips Corporation at the Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin in 1963 and marketed in 1965 as a device purely intended for portable speech-only dictation machines. There was never any intention that it be a replacement for reel-to-reel recorders. The tape width was nominally 1‚ÅÑ8 inch (actually 0.15 inch, 3.81 mm) and tape speed was 1.875 inches (4.8 cm) per second, giving a decidedly non Hi-Fi frequency response and quite high noise levels.
