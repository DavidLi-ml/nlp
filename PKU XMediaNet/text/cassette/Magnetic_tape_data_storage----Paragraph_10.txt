LINCtape, and its derivative, DECtape, were variations on this "round tape." They were essentially a personal storage medium. The tape was 0.75 inches (19 mm) wide and featured a fixed formatting track which, unlike standard tape, made it feasible to read and rewrite blocks repeatedly in place. LINCtapes and DECtapes had similar capacity and data transfer rate to the diskettes that displaced them, but their "seek times" were on the order of thirty seconds to a minute. The inter-record gap (IRG) of Magnetic tape is .75 inches (19 mm).
