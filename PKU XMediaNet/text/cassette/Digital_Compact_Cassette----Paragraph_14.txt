After the Reed-Solomon error correction and by scattering the data across the tracks in a "checkerboard pattern" followed by 8b/10b encoding, the final bit rate to tape is 768 kBps, which is recorded in the eight 96 kBps data tracks. According to the Philips webpage, it was possible for a DCC recorder to recover all missing data off a tape even if one of the 8 audio tracks was completely unreadable, or if all tracks were unreadable for 1.45 mm (about 0.03 seconds).
