The tape speed of DCC was the same as for analog cassettes: 1 7⁄8 inches (4.8 cm) per second, and DCC cassettes used tape that was the same width as analog cassettes: 1/8 of an inch (3.175 mm). The tape that was used in production cassettes was chromium dioxide- or cobalt-doped ferric-oxide, 3-4 µm thick in a total tape thickness of 12 µm, identical to the tape that was widely in use for video tapes.
