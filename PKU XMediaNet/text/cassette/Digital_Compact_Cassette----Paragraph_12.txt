The (theoretical) capacity of a DCC tape is 120 minutes, compared to 3 hours for DAT, however no 120-minute tapes were ever produced. Also, because of the switch to side B, there would always be an interruption in the sound at the end of side A, so the maximum theoretical continuous recording time was 60 minutes. DCC recorders could record from digital sources that used the S/PDIF standard, at 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, or they could record from analog sources at 44.1 kHz. Because of the low tape speed, the achievable bit rate was limited. To compensate, Philips used an audio compression codec based upon MPEG-1 Audio Layer I (MP1) and termed PASC (Precision Adaptive Sub-band Coding). PASC lowered the typical bitrate of a CD recording of approximately 1.4 megabits per second to the much lower bitrate of 384 kilobits per second, a compression ratio of around 4:1.
