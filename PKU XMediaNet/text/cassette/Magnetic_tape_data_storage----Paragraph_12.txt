The type of packaging is a large determinant of the load and unload times as well as the length of tape that can be held. A tape drive that uses a single reel cartridge has a takeup reel in the drive while cassettes have the take up reel in the cassette. A tape drive (or "transport" or "deck") uses precisely controlled motors to wind the tape from one reel to the other, passing a read/write head as it does.
