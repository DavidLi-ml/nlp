There was only one DCC-recorder that had the capability of being connected to, and controlled by a computer: the DCC-175. It was a portable recorder that was developed in Japan (unlike most of the other Philips recorders which were developed in The Netherlands and Belgium), and looked very similar to the other portables available from Philips and Marantz at the time: the DCC-134 (player) and the DCC-170. The DCC-175 was sold only in the Netherlands, and was available separately or in a package with the "PC-link" data cable which could be used to connect the recorder to a printer port of an IBM compatible PC. Only small quantities of both recorder and cable were made, leaving many people searching for one or both at the time of the demise of DCC. The cable contained a couple of custom chips that were made especially for this purpose, which made it impossible for people who owned a DCC-175 but no PC-link cable to make their own. Also, even though the outside of the DCC-170 was similar to the DCC-175, they were radically different on the inside so it wasn't possible to make a 175 out of a 170.
