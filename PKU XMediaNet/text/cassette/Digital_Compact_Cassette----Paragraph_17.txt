On later generations of recorders, it was possible to make a third tape type, called "super user tapes", by entering title information for each track. However, contrary to prerecorded tapes, the title information was stored only once, at the start of the track, right after the track marker, so unlike prerecorded tapes it wasn't possible to see what the name of the track was at any position within the track (the user would need to rewind to the beginning of the track), and there was no way to enter album information. Entering track information was a slow process (although easier with a remote control), only upper-case characters were supported and some commonly used symbols such as the apostrophe were missing.
