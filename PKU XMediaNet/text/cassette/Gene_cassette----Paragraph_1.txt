Integrons are genetic structures in bacteria which express and are capable of acquiring and exchanging gene cassettes. These cassettes typically carry a single gene without a promoter. The entire series of cassettes is transcribed from an adjacent promoter. The gene cassettes are speculated to be inserted and excised via a circular intermediate. This would involve recombination between short sequences found at their termini and known as 59 base elements (59-be) - which may not be 59 bases long. The 59-be are a diverse family of sequences that function as recognition sites for the site-specific integrase (enzyme responsible for integrating the gene cassette into an integron).
