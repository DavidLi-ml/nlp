As a basic comparison, mainframe-class tape drives, such as Oracle's Sun StorageTek T10000B, are priced at approximately US$37,000 each, excluding tape libraries. (IBM's TS1130 is also representative of this storage class.) At any single moment in time each T10000C tape drive can read or write (or both read and write) to one tape cartridge which can contain up to 5TB of uncompressed data. Real-world sequential data transfer speeds are high (sustained 240MB/second for the T10000C and 160MB/second for the TS1130) compared to disk. However, PC-class hard disks are priced below $200 for 3TB. One mainframe-class hard disk still has a much lower price than one mainframe-class tape drive, so the economics might favor disk.
