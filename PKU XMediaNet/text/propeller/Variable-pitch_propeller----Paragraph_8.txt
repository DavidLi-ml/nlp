Another common type was originally developed by Wallace R. Turnbull and refined by the Curtiss-Wright Corporation. This electrically-operated mechanism was first tested in on June 6, 1927 at Camp Borden, Ontario, Canada and patented in 1929 (U.S. Patent 1,828,348). It was favoured by some pilots in World War II, because even when the engine was no longer running the propeller could be feathered. On hydraulically-operated propellers the feathering had to happen before the loss of hydraulic pressure in the engine.
