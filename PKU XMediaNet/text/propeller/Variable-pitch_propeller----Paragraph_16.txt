Bruntons, a UK engineering firm in Essex, manufactures their patented "AutoProp", a marine propeller where the blades swivel freely and automatically set to the optimum angle. The Autoprop is suitable for small to medium yachts and working boats. Unlike a fixed blade propeller, the Autoprop operates exactly as efficiently forward as in reverse, which is important for stopping and manoeuvering. The AutoProp is particularly beneficial for motorsailers, since if the sails are set, but the wind strength is insufficient to make good progress, the engine can be run and the Autoprop will then automatically coarsen to acknowledge the vessel's wind-driven speed component. When solely under sail, a motorsailer's Autoprop will automatically feather to give the minimum drag resistance.
