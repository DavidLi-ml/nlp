Contrary to popular belief, a self-feathering propeller is not more efficient than a fixed bladed prop, as neither type can adopt an optimal blade angle. An exception is the Brunton Autoprop, which is not a typical folding propeller, but a self-actuating variable-pitch propeller. On a boat, most propellers are much less effective in astern, and this is particularly true of folding propellers; whereas the Brunton AutoProp is as effective astern as ahead. (Of course, aircraft have no reverse gear).
