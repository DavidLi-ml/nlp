A folding propeller is a type of propeller whose blades automatically fold out when the engine is turning, and then fold back (or "feather") when the engine stops. Folding propellers are found on sailing yachts, on model airplanes, and increasingly on self-launching gliders and small motor gliders, such as the AÃ©riane Swift PAS. Their purpose of folding propellers is to reduce drag when sailing or soaring, respectively.
