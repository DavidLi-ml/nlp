A virtualisation to render the blade pitch yawning is through car gears. Through an integer yaw pitch of 0-13 degree operating is same: low speed, and more power and acceleration by up gearing the leaver slide. The upper gear of normal cars is comparing to a propeller with a pitch angle of 17+. Good acceleration and top end speed is offered at 21 pitch. A pitch higher than 21 is dangerous because lowering shaft of gearbox back to #1 position stalls engine and blades may crack due to watter pressure. (read lugging of engine here!) The best estimate is that for every 2-inch pitch increase equal wide-opens thrust increase step of approximately 400 RPM. An increase in pitch will cause the rpm-gauge to drop, and an increase in pitch will raise RPM.
