Vessels with medium or high speed diesel or gasoline engines use a reduction gear to reduce the engine output speed to an optimal propeller speed—although the large low speed diesels, whose cruising RPM is in the 80 to 120 range, are usually direct drive with direct-reversing engines. While an FPP-equipped vessel needs either a reversing gear or a reversible engine to reverse, a VPP vessel may not. On a large ship the VPP requires a hydraulic system to control the position of the blades. Compared to an FPP, a VPP is more efficient in reverse as the blades’ leading edges remain as such in reverse also, so that the hydrodynamic cross-sectional shape is optimal for both forward and reverse.
