In the mid-1970s, Uljanik shipyard in Yugoslavia produced four VLCCs with VPPs – a tanker and three ore/oil carriers – each powered by two 20,000 bhp B & W diesel engines directly driving Kamewa variable-pitch propellers. Due to the high construction cost none of these vessels ever returned a profit over their lifetimes. For these vessels, fixed-pitch propellers would have been more appropriate.
