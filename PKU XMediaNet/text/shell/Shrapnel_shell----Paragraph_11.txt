The size of shrapnel balls in World War I was based on two considerations. One was the premise that a projectile energy of 58 foot-pounds force (79 J) (US Army calculation) to 60 foot-pounds force (81 J) (British calculation) was required to disable an enemy soldier. A typical World War I 3-inch (76 mm) field gun shell at its maximum possible range traveling at a velocity of 250 feet/second, plus the additional velocity from the shrapnel bursting charge (about 150 feet per second), would give individual shrapnel bullets a velocity of 400 feet per second and an energy of 60 foot/pounds (81 joules) : this was the minimum energy of a single half-inch lead-antimony ball of approximately 170 grains (11 g), or 41-42 balls = 1 pound. Hence this was a typical field gun shrapnel bullet size.
