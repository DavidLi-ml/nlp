Shotshells are also available in non-shotgun calibers, for use in rifled barrels from .22 Long Rifle upwards through .38 Special to .44 Magnum; these are often used in revolvers to kill snakes at very close ranges, or for killing small pests such as rats. A number of single shot pistols and rifles are made in .45 Colt with special screw-in chokes allowing the use of .410 shellsâ€”usually the chokes are designed with deep grooves parallel to the bore designed to stop the spin of the shot column, as the .45 Colt barrel is rifled. Taurus sells a model called The Judge, which accommodates both .45 Colt and .410 shotshells. Recently, S&W came out with a similar revolver dubbed the "Governor," which not only shoots .45 Colt and .410 shotshells but also .45 ACP with the aid of moon clips.
