The British system is based on the amount of shot per ounce. The sizes are LG (Large Grape - from grape shot derived from musket shooting), MG (Medium Grape), and SG (Small Grape). For smaller game SSG shot is half the weight of SG, SSSG shot is half the weight of SSG, SSSSG shot is half the weight of SSSG, and so on. The Australian system is similar except they have 00-SG, a Small Game shell filled with #00 Buck.
