apertural view: this is the most common viewing angle. The shell is shown in its full length with its aperture facing the viewer and the apex at the top. When the aperture is on the right side, then the shell is called "right-handed" or dextral; if the aperture is on the left side, the shell is called "left-handed" or sinistral.
