Larger sizes of shot, large enough that they must be carefully packed into the shell rather than simply dumped or poured in, are called "buckshot" or just "buck". Buckshot is used for hunting larger game, such as deer ("buck" being a word for a male deer, hence derivation of the name). Buckshot size is designated by actual diameter or (traditionally) by letter or number, with smaller numbers being larger shot. Sizes larger than "0" ("aught") are designated by multiple zeros. "00" ("double-aught") is the most commonly used size.
