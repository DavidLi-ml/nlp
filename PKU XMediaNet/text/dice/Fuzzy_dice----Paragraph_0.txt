Fuzzy dice, also known as fluffy dice, are an automotive decoration consisting of two oversized (usually six-sided) plush dice which hang from the rear-view mirror. The original fuzzy dice used in the 1950s were white and approximately 3" square. Nowadays, fuzzy dice come in many colors (including fluorescents, with bright pink or blue being popular) and are available in many sizes. In Britain and other parts of the world it is considered kitsch to display such items in a car.
