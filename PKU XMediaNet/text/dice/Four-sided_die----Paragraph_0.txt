Four-sided dice, abbreviated d4, are often used in tabletop role-playing games to obtain random integers in the range 1â€“4. Two forms exist of this die: a tetrahedron (pyramid shape) with four equilateral triangle-shaped faces, and an elongated long die with four faces. The former type does not roll well and is thus usually thrown into the air or shaken in a box.
