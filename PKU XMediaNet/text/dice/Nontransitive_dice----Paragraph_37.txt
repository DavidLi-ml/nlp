There are two major issues with this set, however. The first one is that in a two-die option of the game, the first chain should stay exactly the same in order to make the game nontransitive. In practice, though, D actually beats C. The second problem is that the third player would have to be allowed to choose between a one-die option and a two-die option â€“ which may be seen as unfair to other players.
