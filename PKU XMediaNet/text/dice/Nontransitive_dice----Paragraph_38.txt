The issue of D defeating C arises because the dice have 6 faces rather than 5. By replacing the highest or lowest face with "reroll", all five dice will function exactly as Dr James Grime intended. Alternatively, these faces could be mapped to a 10 sided die, with each face repeated exactly once, eliminating the need for reroll. This solution was discovered by Jon Chambers, an Australian Pre-Service Mathematics Teacher.
