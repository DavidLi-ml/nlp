A hand grenade is delivered by being thrown. Grenades can also be projected by other means, such as being launched from the muzzle of a rifle, as in the rifle grenade or using a grenade launcher such as the M203 or by attaching a rocket to the explosive grenade as in a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG).
