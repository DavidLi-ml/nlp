Because liquid-filled objects like the human body are resistant to gross overpressure, the 4-5 psi blast overpressure would cause very few direct casualties at the ~600 m range. The powerful winds produced by this overpressure, however, could throw bodies into objects or throw debris at high velocity, including window glass, both with potentially lethal results. Casualties would be highly variable depending on surroundings, including potential building collapses.
