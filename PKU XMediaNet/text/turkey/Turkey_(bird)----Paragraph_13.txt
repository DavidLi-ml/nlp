The species Meleagris gallopavo is used by humans for their meat. However, they were first domesticated by Native Americans from 800BC onwards for their feathers, which were used in ceremonies and to make robes and blankets. Turkeys were first used for meat by Native Americans in around 1100AD. Compared to wild turkeys, domestic turkeys are selectively bred to grow larger in size for their meat. Humans normally eat turkeys on special occasions such as at Thanksgiving or Christmas. Properly roasting a turkey is an intense process that is sometimes augmented with other meats into elaborate dishes known as turducken. Vegetarian analogues made from tofu are known as tofurkey, while tofurky is a specific turkey alternative product that is a trademark of Oregon-based Turtle Island Foods.
