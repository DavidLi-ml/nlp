Center piece of the gamelan is important and controls the deep wah wah effect. Weight of the center piece and its shape controls the quality of gong. Tension raises the pitch, weight of the middle piece lowers the pitch. If you hammer out in the center piece, you can control the umbak. If you lower too deep, gong loses its centralized sound and turns in to tam tam.
