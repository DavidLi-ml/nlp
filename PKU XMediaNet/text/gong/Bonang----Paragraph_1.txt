Bonang panerus is the highest of them, and uses the smallest kettles. It generally covers two octaves (sometimes more in slendro on Solonese-style instruments), covering approximately the same range as the saron and peking combined. It plays the fastest rhythms of the bonang, either interlocking with or playing at twice the speed of the bonang barung.
