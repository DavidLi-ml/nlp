An essential part of the orchestra for Chinese opera is a pair of gongs, the larger with a descending tone, the smaller with a rising tone. The larger gong is used to announce the entrance of major players and/or of men and to identify points of drama and consequence. The smaller gong is used to announce the entry of lesser players and/or of women and to identify points of humour.
