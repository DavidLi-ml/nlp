Historically among the main lowland Philippine groups (Tagalog, Visayan, Kapampangan, Ilocano) agung orchestras similar to the ones found today among non-hispanised indigenous groups in the country, were among the main instrumental ensembles used up until the 17th century, as evidenced by the agung ensemble encountered by Pigafetta in Cebu in the 16th century, similar in set up (two sanang, two agung and one gimbal) to the basal ensemble of the Palawan people.
