The Stiffleg derrick, also known as a Scotch derrick, is a derrick with a boom similar to a guy derrick, but instead of using guy wires to secure the top of the mast, it uses two or more stiff members, called stifflegs, which are capable of resisting either tensile or compressive forces. Sills may also be used to connect between the bottom ends of the stifflegs and the base of the mast. There may be a counterweight to place on the siils behind the stifflegs in heavy load lifting. Stiffleg derrick on a vessel is called a floating stiffleg derrick. Derricks are especially useful for high rise rigging, jobs that cover a long period of time, or jobs when the impact to the street/pedestrian traffic is a concern.
