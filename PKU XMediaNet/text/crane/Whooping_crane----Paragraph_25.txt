Due to the vulnerability of the Florida non-migratory population, an attempt is being made to establish a second non-migratory population in Louisiana's White Lake Wetlands Conservation Area. This is a cooperative effort of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Geological Survey, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the Louisiana Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit at LSU, and the International Crane Foundation. In March 2011, 10 cranes were released, but all but three had been lost by the time a second group of 16 were released in December. Subsequent cohorts followed, with 14 released in December 2012, 10 in January 2014, 14 in December 2014 an 11 in January 2016. The flock has established a range that includes the lower Mississippi in Louisiana, and as far into Texas as Wise County, Texas, west of Dallas. As of June 2016, the population numbered 38 birds, out of 75 released. Predation and collision with power lines have been documented causes of mortality, but the population has also seen significant mortality from shooting incidents, losing two cranes and likely three in October 2011, one in April 2013, two in February 2014, one in November 2014, two in November 2015 and another two in May 2016. None of the first group released survived to adulthood, but in the Spring of 2014 the second cohort of birds began to form pairs and nest, producing the population's first eggs, although since the parents were still juveniles these eggs were infertile. The next year saw fertile eggs but none survived to hatching, but in April 2016 the hatching of a chick to a pair of the reintroduced cranes represented the first in the wild in Louisiana since 1939.
