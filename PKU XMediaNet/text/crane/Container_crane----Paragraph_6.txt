The largest modern container cranes are classified as "super-post-Panamax" (for vessels of about 22 or more containers wide). A modern container crane capable of lifting two 20-foot (6.1 m) long containers at once (end to end) under the telescopic spreader will generally have a rated lifting capacity of 65 tonnes. Some new cranes have a 120-tonne load capacity, enabling them to lift up to four 20-foot (6.1 m) or two 40-foot (12 m) containers. Cranes capable of lifting six 20-foot containers have also been designed. Post-Panamax cranes weigh approximately 800–900 tonnes, while the newer-generation super-post-Panamax cranes can weigh 1,600–2,000 tonnes. Super Post-Panamax Quay Cranes of Doosan make are equipped to handle safe working load of 41 MTs (single) / 65 MTs (twin) / 85 MTs (underhook) and has an outreach of 23 rows across the vessel. These cranes can handle the largest container vessel floating in the world today
