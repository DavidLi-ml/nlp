A second involved the establishment of a non-migratory population near Kissimmee, Florida by a cooperative effort led by the U.S. and Canadian Whooping Crane Recovery Team in 1993. A total of 289 birds were released into this population between 1993 and 2004. As of December 18, 2006, this population numbered about 53 birds, but a decision was made not to introduce further birds into this population until problems with high mortality and lack of reproduction were resolved, and as of winter 2014/15 the population had shrunk to 16 cranes.
