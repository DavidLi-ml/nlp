Offload: This release mechanism requires the weight (load) of the lifeboat to not be on the hook when it is released. This includes the titanic era Monomony hook design that requires someone to remove the hook from the lifeboat by hand. But this type also includes the hydrostatic system many lifeboats use now. For this, a float is raised up and engages the release once the craft is in the water to the right depth.
