The first modern, self-igniting match was invented in 1805 by Jean Chancel, assistant to Professor Louis Jacques Th√©nard of Paris. The head of the match consisted of a mixture of potassium chlorate, sulfur, sugar, and rubber. The match was ignited by dipping its tip in a small asbestos bottle filled with sulfuric acid. This kind of match was expensive and its usage was dangerous, so Chancel's matches did not become common.
