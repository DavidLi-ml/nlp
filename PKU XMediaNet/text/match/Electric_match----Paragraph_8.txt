In addition to the readily ignitable component of the electric match pyrogen, some matches may also add additional components to provide a hotter, longer lasting flame, for igniting items that are difficult to ignite. For example, igniters for solid fuel model rocket motors often include powdered metals, which provide more heat and duration to the match flame, and a more reliable ignition of the motor.
