Smoking tobacco was lit a number of different ways. One was use of a spill, which was a thin object like a straw, rolled paper, or thin candle, which would be lit from a nearby fire and then used to light the pipe or cigar, often kept near the fireplace in a spill vase. Another was to use a striker, a tool that looked like scissors, but with flint on one "blade" and steel on the other. These would be rubbed together, producing sparks. If neither of these were available, one could use ember tongs to pick up a coal from a fire and light the tobacco.
