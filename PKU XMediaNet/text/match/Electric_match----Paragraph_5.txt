Commercial electric match manufacturers often specify 3 key parameters of an electric match: the resistance (often around 2 Ohm), a recommended firing current (often around 1 A), and a maximum no-fire current. The "test" button on a firing systems typically tests a setup by sending a current limited to well below the no-fire current (often 0.2 A) to detect common problems (short circuits and disconnected open circuits).
