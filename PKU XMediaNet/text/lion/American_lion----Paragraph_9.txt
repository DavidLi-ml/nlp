Fewer American lions are in the La Brea tar pits than other predators such as saber-toothed cats (Smilodon fatalis) or dire wolves (Canis dirus), which suggests they may have been smart enough to avoid the hazard. American lions likely preyed on North American deer, horses (now extinct), camels, and tapirs, and American bison, mammoths, and other large, herbivorous animals. Evidence for predation on bison by American lions is particularly strong as a freeze-dried carcass nicknamed "Blue Babe" was discovered in Alaska and bears bite and claw marks from lions. Based on the largely intact nature of the carcass, the bison was frozen before the lions could devour the meat. This species disappeared about the same time as other megafaunal species during the Quaternary extinction event, which wiped out many of the species on which the American lion would have preyed. Lion bones have been found in the trash heaps of Paleolithic American Indians, suggesting human predation may have contributed to its extinction.
