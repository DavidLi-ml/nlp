Lions also attack domestic livestock and in India cattle contribute significantly to their diet. Lions are capable of killing other predators such as leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, and wild dogs, though (unlike most felids) they seldom devour the competitors after killing them. A lion may gorge itself and eat up to 30 kg (66 lb) in one sitting; if it is unable to consume all the kill it will rest for a few hours before consuming more. On a hot day, the pride may retreat to shade leaving a male or two to stand guard. As revealed by fossil evidence at Olduvai, Tanzania, lions will occasionally drag their carcasses to a more sheltered spot to eat (as tigers and leopards are known to do), allowing them to consume more of a carcass without interference from scavengers. An adult lioness requires an average of about 5 kg (11 lb) of meat per day, a male about 7 kg (15 lb).
