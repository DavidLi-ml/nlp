The earliest lions known in the Americas south of Alaska are from the Sangamonian Stage - the last interglacial - following which, the American lion spread widely from Alberta to Maryland, reaching as far south as Chiapas, Mexico. It has been found in more locations in the west of North America than in the east. It was generally not present in the same areas as the jaguar, as the latter favored forests, while American lions preferred open habitats. The American lion was formerly believed to have colonized northwestern South America as part of the Great American Interchange. However, the fossil remains found in the tar pits of Talara, Peru actually correspond to an unusually large jaguar. Like many other large mammals, it became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. The most recent fossil, from Edmonton, dates to 11,355 Â± 55 years ago.
