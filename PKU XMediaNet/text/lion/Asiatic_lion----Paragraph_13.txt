Lions inhabited the southern part of the Balkan peninsula up to Macedonia and probably the Danube River, but disappeared in Greece around the first century.

Pocock suggested that their restricted distribution in India indicated that they were comparatively recent immigrants that came to India through Persia and Baluchistan.
