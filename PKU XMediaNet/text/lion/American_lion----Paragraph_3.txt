Around 100 specimens of the American lion have been recovered from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, so their body structure is well known. The features and teeth of this extinct lion strongly resemble those of modern lions, but they were considerably larger, and are believed to be the largest subspecies of lion.
