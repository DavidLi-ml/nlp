To make a wrought-iron nail, iron ore is heated with carbon (to create wrought iron) and shaped into square rods. To make a nail, a blacksmith heats the rod in a forge and tapers the end of the bar while keeping the cross section square. Next, the smith cuts off the taper, and inserts it into a nail heading tool with a square hole. The top of the taper is hammered downward (upset) to form a head.
