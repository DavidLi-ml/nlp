Lag screws (US) or coach screws (UK / Australia / New Zealand) (also referred to as bolts, although this is a misnomer) are large wood screws. Square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1 standards, and the head is typically an external hex. A typical lag bolt can range in diameter from 1⁄4 in (6.35 mm) to 1 1⁄4 in (31.75 mm), and lengths from 1⁄4 to 6 in (6.35 to 152.40 mm) or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).
