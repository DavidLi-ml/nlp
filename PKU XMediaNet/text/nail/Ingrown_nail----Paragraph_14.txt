Surgical treatment for ingrown nails are done by foot and ankle specialists. This is typically an in-office procedure requiring local anesthesia and specialty surgical instruments. The surgical approach is a partial nail avulsion of the medial and lateral nail plate known as a "partial wedge resection". If the ingrown toenail recurs despite this treatment, destruction of the sides of the nail with chemicals or excision is done known as a matrixcestomy. Antibiotics may be used post procedure but are not recommended as they may delay healing.
