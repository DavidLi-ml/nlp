Match or target hollow-point bullets are designed for precision target use, and no consideration is given to their expansion or other terminal ballistic performance. The United States military claims to use hollow-point bullets in some sniper rifles for their exceptional accuracy at long ranges, and claim that the hollow-point does not result in wounds significantly different from full metal jacket ammunition in practice.
