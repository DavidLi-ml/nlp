Although some bullet casting procedures can be accomplished with heating elements used for cooking; care must be taken to avoid contaminating food preparation areas and/or utensils with lead alloys. Most bullet casters prefer to use portable electric melting pots in areas with good ventilation. Molten metal can cause serious burns; and molten metal can be sprayed around the working area by violently expanding steam if it comes in contact with water from spilled drinks or other sources. Bullet casters should wear protective clothing including eye protection, and should carefully wash hands prior to eating, drinking, or smoking. Young children are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning and are unlikely to appreciate the danger of shiny molten metal and newly cast bullets. Bullet casting must be limited to times and locations when children are absent. Particular risk comes from the oxides of lead and other metals present in lead alloys, as oxides are often more easily absorbed than the metallic forms. This means that the dross that is skimmed from the lead pot may pose a larger hazard than the metallic alloys.
