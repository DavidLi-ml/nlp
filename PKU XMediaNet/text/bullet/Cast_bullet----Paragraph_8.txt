Pure lead was used to cast hollow base bullets for Civil War era muskets. These bullets were designed to load easily and then expand into the grooves of the rifling when fired. Pure lead is undesirably soft for casting bullets not requiring such expansion. Tin is a common alloying element. Lead alloyed with a small amount of tin fills out moulds more uniformly than pure lead. Tin also increases the hardness of cast bullets up to a maximum at about eight to ten percent tin. Tin is relatively expensive, so many modern alloys rely upon antimony to increase hardness while retaining the casting advantages of a minimal addition of tin. Linotype metal is a eutectic alloy of 3% tin, 12% antimony, and 85% lead. It is a very satisfactory alloy for casting most bullets. However, bullets from Linotype alloy tend to be brittle, and not suitable for some game hunting.
