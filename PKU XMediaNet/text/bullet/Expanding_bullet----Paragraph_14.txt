Because the Hague convention applies only to the use of expanding bullets in war, the use of expanding rounds remains legal, or even required, in some circumstances. Examples of this are use of appropriately expanding bullets in hunting, where it is desirable to stop the animal quickly either to prevent loss of a game animal, or ensure a humane death of vermin, and in law enforcement or self-defence, where quickly neutralising an aggressor may be needed to prevent further loss of life, or where the bullet must remain inside the target to prevent collateral damage.
