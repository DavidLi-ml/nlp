Heat treating can increase the hardness of commonly used lead alloys. The basic procedure is to rapidly cool, or quench, hot bullets. Some suggest this can be done by dropping hot bullets from the mold into a tub of water; but this procedure carries the risk of splashing water onto the mold or into the molten casting metal and causing a steam explosion. An alternative procedure is to re-heat cast bullets (usually in a wire mesh basket) in a temperature-controlled oven and then remove and quench. The oven temperature should be less than the melting temperature of the bullet alloy. This temperature will vary with the concentrations of alloying elements; but is often in the range of 450 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (230 to 260 degrees Celsius).
