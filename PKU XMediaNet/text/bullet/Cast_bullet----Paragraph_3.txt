Bullet casting remained popular for shooters accustomed to older weapons. Firearms were often sold with a mould designed for that particular weapon; so individuals living in remote areas would be able to manufacture their own ammunition rather than relying upon undependable supplies from local merchants. The uniform fit of bullets from an individual mould offered superior accuracy when early manufacturing tolerances were comparatively large.
