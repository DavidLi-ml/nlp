Frangible bullets offer improved safety for specialized combat simulation training involving firing at an array of multiple steel targets in various directions encountered while moving through a maze. Frangible bullets are also used in reduced ricochet, limited penetration (RRLP) loads intended to reduce risk to friendly forces and innocent persons during close quarters military or police actions in urban areas, aboard ships, or in hazardous material environments like oil platforms and chemical or nuclear plants.
