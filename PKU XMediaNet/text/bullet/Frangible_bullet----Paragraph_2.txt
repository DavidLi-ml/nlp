Powder metallurgy techniques fabricate bullets from mixtures of powdered metals (typically tin, copper, zinc, and/or tungsten) compressed at room temperature to produce a high-density material. Mechanical interlocking and cold welding bond the metals together either pressed directly to shape, or into bar stock billets that can be swaged into projectiles, with or without jacketing.
