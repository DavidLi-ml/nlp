One kind of smart bullet is a projectile that is capable of changing its course during flight. One use of this would be to enable soldiers to stay behind protective cover and shoot around corners. One implementation uses a muscle wire inside the bullet. The wire shortens or lengthens, causing the bullet to bend. Another implementation uses a spoiler and micro gyro to control the bullet.
