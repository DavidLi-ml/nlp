Jacketed soft point is usually abbreviated JSP in the ammunition and reloading industry. Jacketed flat point (JFP) is also used for soft-point bullets with a flat, rather than a rounded front. Until recently, flat-point bullets were required in centerfire rifles with tubular magazines, such as the Winchester rifle, where the rounds are stored front-to-back. Use of metal-pointed bullets in these rifles was believed be highly dangerous, as the point of the bullet will rest against the primer of the round in front of it and thought to cause a detonation under the force of recoil, however this was disproved by the Youtube channel Taofledermaus.[1]
