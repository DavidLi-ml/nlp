"Ballistic Tip" is a registered trademark of Nosler, but numerous other companies produce similar projectiles, including Hornady and Sierra. Nosler has always used a color code to indicate caliber on the polymer bullet tips, to make them easily distinguishable from each other: .224 orange,.257-blue, 6mm-purple, 6.5mm-tan, .270-yellow, 7mm-red, .30-green, .338 maroon and 8mm-dark blue. Hornady almost universally uses red plastic tips. Exceptions to this include the Hornady-produced .224" projectiles with blue plastic tips for use in civilian loads of FNH's proprietary 5.7x28mm cartridge and the "Z-Max" or "Zombie Max" variation of their V-Max ammunition, using green plastic rather than red (and having no other changes from the V-Max other than packaging). Sierra uses green, Barnes uses blue for their "TTSX" bullets, and Swift uses black tips for their "Scirocco" plastic-tipped bullets.
