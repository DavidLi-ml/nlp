After the introduction of cordite as a propellant it was noted that lead bullets fired at the higher velocities were readily stripped as they travelled along the barrel. This led to significantly faster fouling of the barrel as lead deposits built up particularly on rifled barrels. Bullets were jacketed to prevent fouling, although these inflicted less severe wounds. Partially jacketing the bullet allowed the bullet to foul the barrel less while also exposing the soft tip which is designed to expand upon impact and to spread open the harder metal jacket. The mechanism is the same as hollow-point bullets, but the lack of a hollow depression reduces the area upon which the hydraulic pressure can act on the lead, and thus the soft-point bullet expands more slowly than a hollow point.
