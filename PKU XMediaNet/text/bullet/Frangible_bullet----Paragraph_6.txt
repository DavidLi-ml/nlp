Frangible bullets striking animal targets create wounds similar to conventional bullets. Some penetrate soft tissue similar to full metal jacket bullets. Some may disintegrate upon striking bone. Hunting bullets include a frangible core designed to disintegrate when a protective jacket is opened by softer tissue or fluid. Frangible bullets disintegrating in flesh cause very serious wounds with persistent effects. Frangible bullets may damage or defeat personal armor intended to resist traditional lead bullets.
