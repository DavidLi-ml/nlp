Hard targets may be damaged by frangible bullets. Extent of damage increases with velocity of bullet impact. Energy transfer at the point of impact may break brittle targets, and may temporarily soften and permanently deform malleable materials. Target crystalline structure may be changed to increase target damage by subsequent bullets. Steel targets designed to withstand rifle ammunition may be damaged by bullet velocities over 2,700 feet (820 m) per second; and lower velocity bullets may damage steel targets intended for pistol or rimfire ammunition.
