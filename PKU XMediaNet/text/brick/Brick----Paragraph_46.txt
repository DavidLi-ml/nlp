As with the rail process above, the BTK process is continuous. A half-dozen labourers working around the clock can fire approximately 15,000â€“25,000 bricks a day. Unlike the rail process, in the BTK process the bricks do not move. Instead, the locations at which the bricks are loaded, fired, and unloaded gradually rotate through the trench.
