A second practice particularly observed in older examples of brickwork is that of building brickwork thicker than the width of any of its individual bricks. In such cases, some of the bricks may well be tied together into the depth of the wall. If, for example, a wall describing an east-west line is under construction, then bricks oriented to point north-south may be built into the width of the wall, their length spanning two widths of brick and tying the brickwork on the transverse plane. Historically, this was the dominant method for consolidating the transverse strength of walls.
