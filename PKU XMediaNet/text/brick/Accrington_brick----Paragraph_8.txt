The restart is being carried out in two stages: the first phase costing £1.4 million started production in January 2015 with the second phase, which will require further investment of around £350,000, due to follow later in 2015. Hanson say the factory has the capacity to produce 45 million bricks a year and the adjoining quarry has some 30–40 years of clay reserves. In the first week of production the Prime Minister David Cameron (Conservative) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne (Conservative) chose to visit the factory during their election campaign visit to Lancashire.
