Clinker is sometimes spelled "klinker" which is the original Dutch / Low German word. The onomatopoeic verb "klinken" means "to sound", i.e. a "klinker" is a "sounder". (The Dutch word "klinker" also means "vowel".) These brick stones produce a specifically bright sound when hit with or against something, for instance each other.
