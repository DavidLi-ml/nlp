In the United States, modern standard bricks are (controlled by American Society for Testing and Materials ASTM ) about 8 × 3 5⁄8  × 2 1⁄4 inches (203 × 92 × 57 mm). The more commonly used is the modular brick 7 5⁄8  × 3 5⁄8  × 2 1⁄4 inches (194 × 92 × 57 mm). This modular brick of 7 5⁄8 with a 3⁄8 mortar joint eases the calculation of the number of bricks in a given run.
