Intrauterine insemination causes an evolutionary consequence resulting from polyandrous behavior. When multiple males mate with one female, there are multiple sets of sperm gametes in a female mouse. Offspring fertilized by multiple females can compete more strongly for mother's resources and can lead to a decrease in body size and variation in body size.
