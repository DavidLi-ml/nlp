Pygmy mice are often kept as pets but require social interaction, should always be kept as pairs or small colonies. They have quite simple care needs, and are active during both day and night, making them an interesting exotic pet to own, but cannot be handled due to the risk of inadvertently causing internal damage due to their small size and tendency to jump when startled.
