Cactus mice are found in dry desert habitats in southwestern United States and northern Mexico, as well as islands off the coast of the Baja California peninsula and in the Gulf of Mexico. Low average temperatures and lack of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) might limit northern expansion. The cactus mouse occurs sympatrically with four other mice species, including the California mouse, canyon mouse, Eva's desert mouse and the mesquite mouse. The cactus mouse is nocturnal and feeds on seeds, mesquite beans, hackberry nutlets, insects, and green vegetation. Species from Southern California have tested positive for hantavirus.
