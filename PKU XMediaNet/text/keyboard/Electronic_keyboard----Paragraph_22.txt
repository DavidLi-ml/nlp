Dave Smith's company found interest in a cooperative effort with Roland. In 1983, the invention of the musical instrumental digital interface (MIDI) as a standard for digital code transmission digital technology development spurred on more great development in keyboard technology. As now keyboards from totally different manufacturers could communicate through an inexpensive cable. The Sequential Circuits Prophet 600 and the Roland Jupiter 6 communicated at the NAMM trade show and Yamaha soon had the standard implemented into their DX synthesizers which would outsell all previous keyboards.
