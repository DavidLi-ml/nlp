Initially some companies steered away from emulating the subtractive synthesis in the digital realm because it was difficult to model how a filter would respond to these complex signals. By the early '90s some fairly good implementations were beginning to appear. The Peavey DPM series also touted as the first keyboards that could import samples which were not 'sampling keyboards'. They also were the first to use off the shelf DSP chips, which emulated the response of analog filters. This sample playback technology also spawned a vast number of inexpensive consumer units called home keyboards which were sold in electronics stores. As the price of memory began to plummet every company was making keyboards of this type. Casio and Yamaha have led sales in these types of units which feature built in speaker systems, usually can run from batteries or power adapters, and have a library of samples with very limited editing if any. They often use cheap plastic strips of keys to keep cost down.
