âŠž Win (also known as the "super" key) is a quick way to open the Start menu in Microsoft Windows's standard Explorer shell, and can usually be configured to open the main menu in other operating systems. In Microsoft Windows, the Windows key can also be used in combination with other keys to perform desktop-related actions (e.g. Win+M to minimize all open windows, then again to restore them). When connected to a Macintosh computer, the Windows key behaves like the Command key.
