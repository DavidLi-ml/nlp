In 1941 George Jenny's previously prototyped Ondioline became the first truly portable synthesizer keyboard (the Novachord weighted over 500 pounds (230 kg).) More developments were made with the Chamberlin Music Maker in late 1940s and the Mellotron in the early 1950s, which employed mechanisms to play back recordings at speeds that would produce the desired tone for the key being struck. Other technologies improved on this idea over the years. Machines like the Optigan used photo-emulsion to create disks that had images whose density would covert to waveforms when spun in front of a beam/sensor assembly. And finally in 1981 the E-mu Emulator was marketed to digitally store samples and play them back.
