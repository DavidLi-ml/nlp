On a different note, the Kurzweil K150 and the Kawai K5 explored additive synthesis where harmonics can be proportioned to make different tones while enveloping groups of them differently in the mid '80s. RMI had explored this to a limited extent in 1974 with the harmonic synthesizer they produced. It should also be mentioned that they were producing the earliest electric piano machines in 1970. This less common synthesis method is also used in Kawai's last synthesizer product series, the K5000's from 1996. Organs like the Hammond B3 use drawbars to control harmonic content of the tone. But the K5000 has an envelope for each harmonic in the entire audio spectrum and dynamic filter control over that for vast possibilities in sound creation.
