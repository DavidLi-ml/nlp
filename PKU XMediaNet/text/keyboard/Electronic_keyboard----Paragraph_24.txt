But the remaining companies after ARP's demise that had produced analog synthesizers rapidly began to feel the stress. Roland and Korg also of Japan maintained with some innovations of their own and each had 'hit' keyboards (the D50 from Roland and M1 from Korg in the later 1980s) I've heard that total DX series unit sales were on the order of 1 Million. The others from Roland and Korg over 250,000. The success of the D50 and M1 was riding on the back of the Kurzweil K250 which first really applied this technology well in 1984. This machine was the first full digital workstation with facilities to sample acoustic sounds with a microphone and play them back with a rate that is proportioned for the note being struck. Many great samples were included in the unit including a piano sound that is still used in the 2000s. And the samples can be routed through a synthesizer architecture of some kind.
