In 1977 the Yamaha CS-60 and CS-80 began to implement synthesizer 'memory'. However it was merely an alternate set of sliders that hid under a hatch. In 1978 however the OB-1 from Oberheim gave actual electronic storage of the sound settings. The Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 the same year offered this feature in a five voice polyphonic synthesizer. Dave Smith's company developed some other firsts. But the ARP engineers were acquired by Fender when they bought the mismanaged company in 1979. And they complete the Fender Rhodes Chroma, the first computer controlled keyboard. Released in 1981, an Apple computer could be used to run sequencing software that allowed the user to easily program which notes were being hit at particular instants in the song production. The 'Chroma' port only appeared on the successor though. The Chroma Polaris in 1984.
