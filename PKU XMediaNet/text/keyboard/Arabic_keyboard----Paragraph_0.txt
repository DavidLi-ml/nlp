The Arabic keyboard (Arabic: لوحة المفاتيح العربية‎‎) is the Arabic keyboard layout used for the Arabic language. All computer Arabic keyboards contain both Arabic and Latin, as Latin characters are necessary for URLs and Email addresses. Since Arabic is written from right to left, when typing using an Arabic keyboard, the letters will start appearing from the right side of the screen.
