In 1975 the turn towards building a synthesizer of sorts over an organ came to fruition in Moogâ€™s Polymoog. Many patents exist from this keyboard. It incorporated velocity sensitivity for one thing. Each note had its own circuit board with a VCF/VCA chip so that it was truly fully polyphonic. Many were disappointed that the filter lacked the facilities of the more flexible moog filter used in other keyboards. And that there were so many connectors and they were not all that reliable. Also in 1975 Crumar of Italy produced the "Multiman" which also was an organ with synthesizer facilities. It had a bass option, a brass with filter controls and simple envelope, a piano and clavi preset, and a couple string tabs with decay control and vibrato control. The first of what we might call the 'Swiss army knife' synthesizer. In 1976 the ARP Omni combined a more limited synthesizer with a string machine and bass also and became ARP's biggest seller. Also in 1976 the Korg PE-1000 used an individual saw oscillator for each note.
