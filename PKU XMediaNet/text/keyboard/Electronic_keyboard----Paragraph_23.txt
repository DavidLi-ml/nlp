The Yamaha DX7, the most well known synth of the 1980s, used entirely digital circuitry leaving it free from the need of calibration, and vast numbers of parameters that could be accessed. The "FM" (frequency modulation) synthesis method was something that had not been explored to near this depth. Most synthesizers before this were subtractive. i.e. You start with a very harmonic-laden sound and you selectively subtract from them using low, high or bandpass filters, or some other methods that tended to result in stranger sounds like ring modulation. Also in 1983 Dave Smith's company SCI marketed the first polyphonic synthesizer keyboard that could play more than one sound at a time called the 'Six-Trak'. It had a six track sequencer and each track could access a different sound. The same year the SCI Prophet T8 with optical key sensing became the first piano action emulating midi keyboard.
