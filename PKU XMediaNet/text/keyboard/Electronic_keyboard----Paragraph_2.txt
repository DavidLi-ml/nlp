An electronic keyboard may also called a digital keyboard, portable keyboard or home keyboard, referring their digital-based sound generation and light-weight, portable build. In China, Japan, India, and Southeast Asia (particularly Indonesia and Thailand), electronic keyboards were often mistakenly referred to as an organ, due to popularity of home electronic organs in those countries and keyboards/synthesizers are considered as a similar instrument.
