MIDI terminals: Most keyboards usually incorporate MIDI output and input ports for data communication, typically connected with either a computer or another electronic musical instrument, such as a synthesizer or sound module. Not all keyboards has conventional MIDI terminals and connector, but they may have a USB port instead, which serve as both input and output in a single connection.
