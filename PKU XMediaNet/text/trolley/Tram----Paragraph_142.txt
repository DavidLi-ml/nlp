In Almonds and Raisins by Maisie Mosco, a book about Jewish immigration to Manchester, England from mainland Europe in the early twentieth century, the newly arrived Sanberg family see a tram for the first time - a Manchester double-decker. Abraham (the father) exclaims,"A train with two storeys? And no roof?" [Manchester trams were open-topped in those days.] The local rabbi explains: "In English, they call it a tram.... In Yiddish, we don't have a word for it." "In the wire overhead, there's electricity, we don't have a word for that either."
