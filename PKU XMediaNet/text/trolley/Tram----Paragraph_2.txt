Today, most trams use electrical power, usually fed by an overhead pantograph; in some cases by a sliding shoe on a third rail, trolley pole or bow collector. If necessary, they may have dual power systems â€” electricity in city streets, and diesel in more rural environments. Trams are now included in the wider term "light rail", which also includes segregated systems.
