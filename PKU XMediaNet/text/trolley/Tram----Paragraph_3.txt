The English terms tram and tramway are derived from the Scots word tram, referring respectively to a type of trucks (goods wagons or freight railroad cars) used in coal mines, and the tracks on which they ran. The word tram probably derived from Middle Flemish trame ("beam, handle of a barrow, bar, rung"), a Romanesque word meaning the beam or shaft of a barrow or sledge, also the barrow itself. The identical word la trame with the meaning "crossbeam" is also used in the French language. Etymologists believe that the word tram refers to the wooden beams the railway tracks were initially made of before the railroad pioneers switched to the much more resistant tracks made of steel. The word Tram-car is attested from 1873.
