A sculpture of tram 1040, the last numbered of Melbourne's iconic "W" class trams was unveiled at the corner of Flinders and Spencer Streets, Melbourne, in October 2013. The sculpture is the work of local artist David Bell. It can be viewed from a number of tram routes, and is just one block from Southern Cross railway station.
