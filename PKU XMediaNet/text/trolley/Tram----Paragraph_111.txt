Historically, there have been trams in the following Australian cities and towns: Brisbane, Queensland; Rockhampton, Queensland; Sydney, New South Wales; Newcastle, NSW; Maitland, NSW; Broken Hill, NSW; Yass, NSW; Camden, NSW; Melbourne, Victoria; Geelong, Victoria; Ballarat, Victoria; Bendigo, Victoria; Sorrento, Victoria; Adelaide, South Australia; Gawler, South Australia; Victor Harbor, South Australia; Moonta-Wallaroo, South Australia; Perth, Western Australia; Fremantle, WA; Kalgoorlie, WA; Laverton, WA; Hobart, Tasmania; and Launceston, Tasmania. These ranged from extensive systems to single lines. The Sydney system, which closed in 1961, was the most extensive and the largest passenger carrier of any Australian public transport system then or since, moving over 400 million passengers at its peak. Virtually all known types of motive power have been utilised at some stage, in Australia.
