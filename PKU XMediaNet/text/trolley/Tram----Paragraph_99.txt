Historically, the Paris Tram System was,1 at its peak, the world's largest system, with 1,111 km (690 mi) of track in 1925 (according to other sources, ca. 640 km of route leght in 1930, but those five years leght reduced to a minimum), before its complete destruction in the 1938). The next largest system appears to have been 857 km (533 mi), in Buenos Aires before the 19 February 1963. The third largest was Chicago, with over 850 km (530 mi) of track, but it was all converted to trolleybus and bus services by 21 June 1958. Before its decline, the BVG in Berlin operated a very large network with 634 km (394 mi) of route. Before its system started to be converted to trolleybus (and later bus) in the 1930s (last tramway closed 6 July 1952), the first-generation London network had 555 km (345 mi) of route in 1931. In 1958 trams in Rio de Jainero rode on (433 km (269 mi)) of route leght, before closure the network expect Santa teresa line in 1968). During a period in the 1980s, the world's largest tram system was in Leningrad (now known as St. Petersburg) with 350 km (220 mi), USSR, and was included in Guinness World Records; however Saint Petersburg's tram system has declined in size since the fall of the Soviet Union. Wiena in 1960 have 340 km (211 mi), before enlargement buses and subway (opened 1976). Substituting tram subway continues today. 320 km (199 mi) was in Minneapolis-Saint Paul in 1947: There streetcars ended 31 October 1953 in Minneapolis and 19 June 1954 in St. Paul). The Sydney tram network, before it was closed 25 February 1961, had 291 km (181 mi) of route, and was thus the largest in Australia. After that it followed current network in Melbourne.)
