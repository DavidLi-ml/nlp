In addition, trolleybuses are greatly affected by dewirements, where the trolley poles come off of the wires; this occur quite occasionally, especially in areas subject to heavy snowfall. After a dewirement, trolleybuses not equipped with an auxiliary power unit are stranded without power. Nonetheless, dewirements are relatively rare in modern systems with well-maintained overhead wires, hangers, fittings and "contact shoes". Trolleybuses are equipped with special insulated pole ropes which drivers use to reconnect the trolley poles with the overhead wires in case of dewirement. When approaching switches, trolleybuses usually must decelerate in order to avoid dewiring, and this deceleration can potentially add slightly to traffic congestion.
