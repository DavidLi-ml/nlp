When compared to motorbus, trolleybus have much greater difficulties with temporary or permanent re-routings, which are not usually readily available outside of "downtown" areas where the buses may be re-routed via adjacent business area streets where other trolleybus routes operate. This problem was highlighted in Vancouver in July 2008, when an explosion closed several roads in the city's downtown core. Because of the closure, trolleys were forced to detour several kilometers off their route in order to stay on the wires, leaving major portions of their routes not in service and and off-schedule. Futhermore, trolleybuses have unique operating characteristics when comparing to motorbuses, such as trolley drivers having to slow down at turns and through switches in the overhead wire system.
