Allied and—before 1918—German pilots of World War I were not equipped with parachutes, so in-flight fires or structural failure were often fatal. Parachutes were well-developed by 1918 having previously been used by balloonists, and were adopted by the German flying services during the course of that year (the famous Manfred von Richthofen "Red Baron" was wearing one when he was killed), but the allied command continued to oppose their use on various grounds.
