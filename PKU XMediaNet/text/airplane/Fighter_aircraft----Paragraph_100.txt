Fighter aircraft may be fielded anywhere in a continuum ranging on one end from light, relatively simple with only essential features, and lower cost, to on the other end heavier, more complex with added features, and more expensive. The light or lower cost fighter concept is to be on the generally lower half of this range in order to project highly effective force per unit of budget via an efficient design with only essential features. Light fighters generally features a smaller and generally less expensive airframe, deliberately designed to be effective based on a high thrust-to-weight ratio, high maneuverability, high reliability, and moderate per unit cost. Larger fighters provide the opportunity for more technology, such as longer range radars, and for heavier weapon load outs that can make use of longer radar range in addressing a larger number of opponents per friendly fighter. Though stealth is not inherently limited to larger fighters, so far in its history its higher cost has led to it being deployed on larger and more expensive fighters.
