The high practical and budgetary effectiveness of modern light fighters for many missions is why the U.S. Air Force adopted both the F-15 and F-16 in a "hi/lo" strategy of both an outstanding but expensive heavy fighter and a lower cost but still excellent light fighter. This mixture allows using the ideal weapon for the mission at hand, such as heavier fighters with longer range radar and larger weapon load outs for the most demanding Beyond Visual Range missions, and lighter and lower cost fighters for bulk combat against large numbers of enemy fighters.
