Though it has been proven that well designed light fighters can generally compete with and sometimes excel heavier fighters on a per plane basis, they do not always have to do so in order to be effective weapons, so long as their cost is significantly less. For a given budget, lower cost light fighters allow greater numbers, bringing into the play the issue of quantity vs. quality. Larger numbers of fighters that are not too severely inferior can often defeat a smaller force of superior aircraft. Formally, this is a result of Lanchester's laws, a mathematical formulation of attrition rates in combat. With modern weapons that engage multiple targets over a distance, the rate of attrition depends on the number of firing platforms in a non-linear way. Lanchester determined that the power of such a force is proportional not to the number of units it has, but to the square of the number of units. This is known as Lanchester's Square Law. Fundamentally it requires an N-squared-fold advantage in quality on one side to compensate for an N-fold advantage in quantity on the other side. This non-linear relationship favors the low cost and light fighter.
