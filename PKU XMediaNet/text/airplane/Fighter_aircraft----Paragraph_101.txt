In the past some very light fighter designs were sometimes the result of the desire to use a particular engine or non-strategic materials that demand the airframe be as small and light as possible in order to reach acceptable performance with limited available power. That class of ultra-light fighters has often been dismissed by military planners as being too limited in capability, but a few of these very light fighters have been effective. A prominent example is the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero, the lightest major fighter of WWII, which was deliberately designed to be as light as possible to get competitive performance using the limited horsepower engines available in Japan just before WWII. The Zero scored high kill ratios early in WWII, though the Allies later achieved air dominance over it with improved aircraft and tactics.
