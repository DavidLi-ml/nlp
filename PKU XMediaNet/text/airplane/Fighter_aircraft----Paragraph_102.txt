The more modern view of light fighters is as a more capable weapon intended to well satisfy the main criteria of air to air combat effectiveness. These criteria in order of importance are the ability to benefit from the element of surprise, to have numerical superiority in the air, to have superior maneuverability, and weapon systems effectiveness. Light fighters have tended to statistically enjoy the element of surprise more often than not due to smaller visual and radar signatures, which is a critical advantage since historically about 80% of air to air kills do occur by surprise. The comparative lower cost and higher reliability of light fighters due to their intentional simplicity also allows them to out-number the enemy in the air under combat conditions on a per budget basis. Their light weight also enhances maneuverability. It is only in the generally least important (in relative terms) category of weapons systems effectiveness that the more limited weight carrying capacity of a light fighter may work against its capability. However, modern single engine light fighters such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the JAS 39 Gripen generally carry the same type of cannon and air to air missile weaponry as heavier twin engine fighters, simply not as much ammunition or as many missiles. As they are in general approximately as capable and sometimes more capable in air to air combat on a per plane basis as heavier twin engine fighters for many mission types, while being significantly lower in cost, they represent the opportunity to in many cases be more effective on a per budget basis.
