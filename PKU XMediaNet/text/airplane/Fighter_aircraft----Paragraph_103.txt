A prominent example is the American Gen 3 Northrop F-5 light fighter, which has proven in combat and in extensive aggressor and trial usage to be quite competitive with the larger and more expensive fighters of its era, and surprisingly competitive with later Gen 4 fighters that are an order of magnitude more expensive. With its small size it very effectively utilizes the key elements of surprise, lost cost and high reliability, and maneuverability. Though with its limited radar it does not have a strong BVR capability, it can hold its own in the WVR mode even today, over 50 years after its original introduction.
