According to the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, the quaich was inspired by the low silver bowls with two flat handles frequently used as bleeding vessels in England and the Netherlands in the 17th century. Another popular theory suggests that the shape is derived from scallop shells. However, this seems to have had its origins in the now discredited poems of James Macpherson supposedly translations of poems by Ossian, son of Fionn mac Cumhaill.
