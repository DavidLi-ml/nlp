The earliest example in England is the Exeter puzzle jug â€” an example of medieval pottery in Britain. The Exeter puzzle jug dates from about 1300 AD and was originally made in Saintonge, Western France. The puzzle jug is a descendant of earlier drinking puzzles, such as the fuddling cup and the pot crown, each of which has a different solution.
