It's also a term to describe coaching a sports team with a history of winning championships, one feels lucky to manage such a club but then ends up under pressure to win a championship, get a great result within the first year, or they're fired. (For example, teams like Real Madrid, Chelsea and Barcelona or Moyes at Manchester United, where managers have to win a tournament, a league trophy, qualify for Europe, or they're fired within their first year or any year they win nothing.)
