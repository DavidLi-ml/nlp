There are cafe cups in various sizes, standardized to reflect paper cup sizes. They are typically 225, 336, 460 and sometimes 570 ml. Slight variation is to be expected from coffeehouse to coffeehouse, but these sizes are the standard. These are the cups that house mochas, lattes, and other coffee drinks. These cups are also made of porcelain and shaped to encourage and aid in creating latte art.
