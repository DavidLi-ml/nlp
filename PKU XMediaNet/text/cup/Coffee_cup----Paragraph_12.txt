Polystyrene, better known under the trademarked brand name Styrofoam, is used mostly because of its insulating abilities. The use of polystyrene is controversial in coffee cups and other containers because it is non-biodegradable, a major part of marine litter, difficult to recycle, and has various health risks. It is banned as a food and drink container in several U.S. cities including Portland, Ore.; San Francisco, Calif.; and Amherst, Mass. Many more cities are proposing banning the cups. The doughnut company and coffeehouse chain, Dunkinâ€™ Donuts, has been criticized for continuing to use styrofoam cups. The company has argued that there is no other material that is as insulated, and has an official statement about their foam cups on their website. However, they have begun phasing in doubled-walled paper cups designed to look like their signature foam cup.
