Although many moustache cups were made in America, the earliest were marked with names which led buyers to believe they were actually manufactured in England. This was due to the popularity of English-made ceramics. Therefore, with the exception of the quadruple silver moustache cups made in the U.S., it is nowadays extremely difficult to find an authentic Victorian moustache cup bearing an American pottery mark. Moreover, between 1920 and 1930, moustaches progressively began to go out of fashion and hence moustache cup production trickled down along with the then dwindling numbers of the once-popular hirsute appendages. Today though, these examples of Victorian male elegance are coveted and collected by a growing number of enthusiasts.
