A Pythagorean cup (also known as a Pythagoras cup, Greedy Cup, Tantalus cup or o kounenos tsi dikaiosynis) is a practical joke device in a form of a drinking cup, credited to Pythagoras of Samos. When it is filled beyond a certain point, a siphoning effect causes the cup to drain its entire contents through the base.
