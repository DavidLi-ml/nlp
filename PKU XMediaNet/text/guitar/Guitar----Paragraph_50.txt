The types and models of pickups used can greatly affect the tone of the guitar. Typically, humbuckers, which are two magnetâ€“coil assemblies attached to each other are traditionally associated with a heavier sound. Single-coil pickups, one magnet wrapped in copper wire, are used by guitarists seeking a brighter, twangier sound with greater dynamic range.
