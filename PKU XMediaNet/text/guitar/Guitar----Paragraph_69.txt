Another class of alternative tunings are called drop tunings, because the tuning drops down the lowest string. Dropping down the lowest string a whole tone results in the "drop-D" (or "dropped D") tuning. Its open-string notes DADGBE (from low to high) allow for dominant basses in the keys of D and D minor. It simplifies the playing of simple fifths (powerchords). Many contemporary rock bands re-tune all strings by several semi-tones, making, for example, Drop-C or Drop-B tunings.
