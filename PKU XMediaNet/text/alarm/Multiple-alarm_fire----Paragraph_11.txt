If the incident commander decides that the incident does not require a higher alarm level to be requested, they can specially request an additional unit to the scene without requesting a full alarm level assignment. For example, at a Working Fire, there are 4 Engine Companies, 3 Ladder Companies, 1 Squad Company, 1 Rescue Company, 2 Battalion Chiefs, and 1 Division Chief operating at the scene. If the fire is not large enough to require a 2nd Alarm, but a need for more equipment and manpower is needed, the commanding Chief can request additional units to respond "Specially Called" to the scene.
