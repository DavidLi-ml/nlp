A clock radio is an alarm clock and an AM/FM radio integrated in one device. They are integrated so that the radio's sound may be used as an alarm. This allows the sleeper to be awakened by radio music/news or a buzzer sound. They are typically placed on the bedside stand. They offer dual alarm and "snooze", a large button on the top that stops the alarm and sets it to ring again at a short time later, most commonly nine minutes. Some clock radios also have a "sleep" timer, which turns the music from radio on for a set amount of time (usually around one hour). This is useful for people who like to fall asleep with the radio on.
