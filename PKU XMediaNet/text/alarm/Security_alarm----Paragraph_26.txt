Motion sensors are devices that use various forms of technology to detect movement. The technology typically found in motion sensors to trigger an alarm includes infrared, ultrasonic, vibration and contact. Dual technology sensors combine two or more forms of detection in order to reduce false alarms as each method has its pros and cons. Traditionally motion sensors are an integral part of a home security system. "These devices are typically installed to cover a large area as they commonly cover up to 40ft with a 135Â° field of vision."
