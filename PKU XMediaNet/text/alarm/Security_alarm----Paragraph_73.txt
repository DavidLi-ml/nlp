In the UK, CSL DualCom Ltd pioneered dual signalling in 1996. In doing so, the company offered the first credible alternative to existing alarm signalling while setting the current standard for professional dual path security monitoring. Dual signalling is now firmly regarded as the standard format for alarm signalling and is duly specified by all of the leading insurance companies.
