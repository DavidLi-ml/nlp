Sirens are also used as musical instruments, such as in Edgard Varèse's compositions Amériques (1918–21, rev. 1927), Hyperprism (1924), and Ionisation (1931); in George Antheil's Ballet Mécanique (1926); in Dimitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 2 (1927); in Henry Fillmore's "The Klaxon: March of the Automobiles" (1929); in The Chemical Brothers' "Song to the Siren"; and, in a CBS News 60 Minutes segment, by experimental percussionist Evelyn Glennie. A variation of a siren, played on a keyboard, are the opening notes of the REO Speedwagon song "Ridin' the Storm Out".
