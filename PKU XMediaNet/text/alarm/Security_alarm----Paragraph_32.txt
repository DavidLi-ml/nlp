This buried security system is based on the Magnetic Anomaly Detection principle of operation. The system uses an electromagnetic field generator powered by two wires running in parallel. Both wires run along the perimeter and are usually installed about 5"/12 cm apart on top of a wall or about 12"/30 cm below ground. The wires are connected to a signal processor which analyzes any change in the magnetic field.
