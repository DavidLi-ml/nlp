Below is a list of the alarm levels used in the response policy of the New York City Fire Department. This is a basic example of how alarm levels are categorized in a fire department, how many fire apparatuses respond to each alarm level, etc. In New York, however, additional special alarm levels are utilized, aside from the conventional 1st Alarm, 2nd Alarm, 3rd Alarm, etc. Examples of such alarm levels are the Signal 10-75 Assignment, the Signals 10-76 and 10-77 Assignments, and the Signal 10-60 Assignment. A 10-75 is a Working Fire (i.e., there is fire visible from a building), the 10-76/10-77 Assignments are the alarm levels separate from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd Alarms, etc. that are the standard fire department responses to fires in high-rise buildings. The Signal 10-60 is a separate response to major disasters. Below is how the alarm levels are categorized in order per protocol and each apparatus count in an addition per alarm.
