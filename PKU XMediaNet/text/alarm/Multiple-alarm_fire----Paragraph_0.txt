One-alarm, two-alarm, three-alarm fires, are categories of fires indicating the level of response by local authorities, with an elevated number of alarms indicating an increased number of phone alarms went off during the fire. The term multiple-alarm is a quick way of indicating that a fire is severe and is difficult to contain. This system of classification is common in the USA among both fire departments and news agencies.
