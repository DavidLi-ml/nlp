In 1982, the United States Football League formed as a spring league, and enjoyed moderate success during its first two seasons behind such stars as Jim Kelly and Herschel Walker. After its spring 1985 season, the league, which lost a considerable amount of money due to overspending on players, opted to gamble on moving its schedule to fall in 1986 and filing a billion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against the NFL and its television partners in an effort to stay afloat. When the lawsuit only drew a three-dollar judgment days before the fall 1986 season was to begin, the USFL folded.
