The heat source under the percolator (such as a range or stove) heats the water in the bottom chamber. Water at the very bottom of the chamber gets hot first and starts to boil. The boiling makes bubbles rise up and push water up the vertical tube then out the top of the vertical tube. From the top of the tube, the water flows out and over the lid of the coffee chamber. Perforations in the lid distribute the water over the top of the coffee grounds. The water then seeps through the coffee grounds then through the bottom of the coffee chamber. From the bottom of the coffee chamber, the water drops onto the colder water at the top of the bottom chamber, helping to force water up the tube. This whole cycle repeats continuously.
