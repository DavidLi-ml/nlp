Electric kettles were introduced as a means to boil water without the necessity of a stove top. They are normally constructed of durable plastic or steel (with a plastic handle) and powered by mains electricity. In modern kettles the heating element is typically fully enclosed, with a power rating of 2 - 3 kW at 220V. In countries with 110V mains electricity, kettles may be less powerful to avoid drawing too much current and requiring a very thick supply wire.
