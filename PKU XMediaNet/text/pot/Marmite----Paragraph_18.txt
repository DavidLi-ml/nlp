Marmite today is fortified with added vitamins, resulting in it being banned in Denmark which disallows foodstuffs that have been fortified. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration stated in 2015 that Marmite had not been banned in the country, but that fortified foods need to be tested for safety and approved before they can be marketed in the country. In 2014 suppliers applied for a risk assessment to be undertaken and Marmite is now available in Denmark.
