Percolators are popular among campers and outdoorspeople because of their ability to make coffee without electricity. Non-pressure percolators may also be used with paper filters. Large 1970s-era percolators are still used in the 2000s at community events, church gatherings and other large group activities where a lot of coffee is needed.
