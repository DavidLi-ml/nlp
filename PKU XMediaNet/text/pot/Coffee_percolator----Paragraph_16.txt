A distinction must be made between the chemical process of percolation and the coffee percolator as a device. In 1880, Hanson Goodrich invented the coffee percolator. His percolator was one of the earliest coffee brewing devices to use percolation rather than infusion or decoction as its mode of extraction, and he named it accordingly. Other brewing methods based on percolation followed, and this early naming convention can cause confusion with other percolation methods.
