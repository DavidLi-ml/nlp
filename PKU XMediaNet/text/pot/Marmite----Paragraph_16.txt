Besides folic acid, Marmite is high in various B vitamins and has been noted as a superfood. It contains Niacin (vitamin B3) which produces neutrophils (a white blood cell) that helps the body's immune system fight against Staphylococcus bacteria. The sodium content of the spread is high and has caused concern, although it is the amount per serving rather than the percentage in bulk Marmite that is relevant. The main ingredient of Marmite is yeast extract, which contains a high concentration of glutamic acid. Marmite made in the United Kingdom and exported to several countries is believed to be gluten free although there is no chemical relation between glutamic acid and gluten, despite the phonetic similarity of the two terms. However, Unilever will not confirm that it contains less than 20 PPM of gluten, the current European standard and the proposed US FDA standard for gluten-free labelling.
