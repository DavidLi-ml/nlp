Also as part of the transition to Crown Colony status, a list of grants was compiled in 1625 and sent to London. This list does not identify the Ancient Planters as such, but in some cases knowledge of the grant combined with information from other sources (e.g., knowledge of the date of arrival) is enough to show that the planter in question must have received the grant as an Ancient Planter.
