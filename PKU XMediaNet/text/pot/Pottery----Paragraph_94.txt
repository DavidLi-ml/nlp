The early inhabitants of Europe developed pottery at about the same time as in the Near East, circa 5500â€“4500 BC. These cultures and their pottery were eventually shaped by new cultural influences and technology with the invasions of Ancient Rome and later by Islam. The Renaissance art of Europe was a melding of the art of Classical era and Islamic art.
