The database of Colonial Land Office Patents at the Library of Virginia is the principal source of information as to the identities of those who received grants as Ancient Planters. Though the record does not begin until 1623, when administration of the colony was taken over by the Crown, many of the subsequent patents identify "ancient planters", or provide information which shows that a tract of land must have been originally granted under the terms applying to Ancient Planters.
