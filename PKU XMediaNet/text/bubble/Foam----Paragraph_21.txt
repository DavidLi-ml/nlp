In addition, due to the stretching of the surface, the surface tension of the indented spot is greater than the surrounding area. Consequentially, since diffusion time for the surfactants is large, the Marangoni effect has time to take place. The difference in surface tension creates a gradient, which instigates fluid flow from areas of lower surface tension to areas of higher surface tension. The second picture shows the film at equilibrium after the Marangoni effect has taken place.
