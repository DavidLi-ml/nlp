While some economists deny that bubbles occur, the cause(s) of bubbles remains disputed by those who are convinced that asset prices often deviate strongly from intrinsic values. Many explanations have been suggested, and research has recently shown that bubbles may appear even without uncertainty, speculation, or bounded rationality. In such cases, the bubbles may be argued to be rational, where investors at every point fully compensated for the possibility that the bubble might collapse by higher returns. These approaches require that the timing of the bubble collapse can only be forecast probabilistically and the bubble process is often modelled using a Markov switching model. It has also been suggested that bubbles might ultimately be caused by processes of price coordination or emerging social norms.
