At the stem of the bubble, the shape of the bubble is nearly cylindrical; consequently, either R3 or R4 will be very large while the other radius of curvature will be very small. As the stem of the bubble grows in length, it becomes more unstable as one of the radius grows and the other shrinks. At a certain point, the vertical length of the stem exceeds the circumference of the stem and due to the buoyancy forces the bubble separates and the process repeats.
