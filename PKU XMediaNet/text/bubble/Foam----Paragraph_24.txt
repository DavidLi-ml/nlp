Reasons for the deviations are due to the Marangoni effect and capillary pressure which affects the assumption that the bubbles are spherical. For laplace pressure of a curved gas liquid interface, the two principle radii of curvature at a point are R1 and R2. With a curved interface, the pressure in one phase will be greater than the pressure in another phase; the capillary pressure Pc is given by the equation of:
