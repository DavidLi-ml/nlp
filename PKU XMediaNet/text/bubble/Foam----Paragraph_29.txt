Since, the density of the gas is less than the density of the liquid the left hand side of the equation will always be positive. Therefore, the inverse of RA must be larger than the RB. Meaning that from the top of the bubble to the bottom of the bubble the radius of curvature will increase; therefore, without neglecting gravity the bubbles cannot be spherical. In addition, as z increases, this will cause the difference in RA and RB too, which means the bubble will deviate more from its shape the larger it grows.
