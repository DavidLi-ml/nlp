Net Result of a Bubble: The one true constant with all bubbles is that they create excess demand and production. Once the bubble deflates, which it always does, a contraction or consolidation has to occur to alleviate the excess. Two examples are the dot-com bubble and the current housing bubble. In both cases there were huge consolidations, bankruptcies, and deterioration of asset values.
