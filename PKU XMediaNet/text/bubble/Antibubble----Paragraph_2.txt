Under ordinary circumstances, antibubbles are short-lived. An air bubble with a soap skin may last several minutes. Antibubbles often have lifetimes of a few seconds or less; however, if the electrical potential between the inner and outer fluid is equalized, antibubbles can last as long as, or longer than, air bubbles. Recently, antibubbles with a lifetime of at least tens of hours were produced by adsorbing colloidal particles at the air-water interfaces of the antibubble.
