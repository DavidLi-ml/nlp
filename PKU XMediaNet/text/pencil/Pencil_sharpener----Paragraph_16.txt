Specialized sharpeners are available that operate on non-standard sizes of pencil, such as the large art pencils used in primary schools. Sharpeners that have two openings, one for normal pencils and one for larger art pencils are still fairly common. Some mechanical sharpeners have a large opening, with a rotating disk in front of it that has several holes of different sizes.
