An advanced ratchet type has a mechanism that twists the pencil lead 6Â° counter-clockwise every time the lead is pressed on to the paper, to evenly distribute wear. This keeps the lead 50% narrower than in the common propelling mechanical pencils, resulting in uniform thickness of the lines written onto the paper. The design was first developed by Mitsubishi Pencil Co., Ltd, and named Kuru Toga. This type of pencil is most suited for Asian languages that have multiple strokes per letter or word, where the pencil is frequently lifted off the paper. The mechanism is not suitable for cursive writing used in western scripts.
