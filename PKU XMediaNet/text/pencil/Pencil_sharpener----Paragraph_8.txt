Unlike prism sharpeners, blade sharpeners do not rotate around the pencil being sharpened and may be viewed as just a special form of knife with a mechanical guide for increased safety and convenience. Some models directly hold replaceable shaving razor blades, others have permanently fitted blades. Blade sharpeners may require more skill, but they allow one to sharpen the tip of the pencil into any desired shape, whereas prism sharpeners have a fixed sharpening angle and produce circular symmetry.
