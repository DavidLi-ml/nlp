Artists and craftspersons may use a very sharp knife to sharpen pencils and other media freehand, without the use of any mechanical guides. The tip is cut into a triangle shape and then the edges of the triangle are trimmed down. This requires a total of 6 cuts and takes practice to master without breaking the lead.
