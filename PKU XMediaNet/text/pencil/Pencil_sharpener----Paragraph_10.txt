A larger, stationary mechanical sharpener can be mounted on a desk or wall and powered by a crank. Typically, the pencil is inserted into the sharpener with one hand and the crank turned with the other. This rotates a set of helical cylindrical cutters in the mechanism, set at a diverging angle to each other. This quickly sharpens the pencil, with a more precise finish than the simpler blade device.
