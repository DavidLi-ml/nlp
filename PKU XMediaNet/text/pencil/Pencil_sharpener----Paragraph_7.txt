Moderate care is needed to not break the tip of the pencil being sharpened, losing the result of work immediately. However, because pencils may have different standard diameters in different nations, imported sharpeners may have non-standard-sized alignment guide-holes, —if it's too-small the pencil cannot be inserted, while too-big (or missing,) and the tip of the pencil constantly breaks off,— making sharpening attempts futile. A few prism sharpeners are hand-cranked, as in the photo above. Prism sharpeners may be right- or left-handed, requiring clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the pencil being sharpened.
