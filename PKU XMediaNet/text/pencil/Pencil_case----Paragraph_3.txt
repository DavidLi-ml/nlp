Early pencil cases were round or cylindrical in shape. Some early pencil cases were decorated with jasper (one from 1860) or platinum (from 1874). In 1946, the first patent for pencil case was placed in the United States. This patent was made by Verona Pearl Amoth. He also invented many other related inventions. For example, he invented replaceable erasers for pencils.
