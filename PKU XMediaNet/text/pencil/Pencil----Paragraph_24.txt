Many pencils across the world, and almost all in Europe, are graded on the European system using a continuum from H (for Hardtmuth (as in Koh-i-noor Hardtmuth) and not, as commonly assumed, "hardness") to B (for Budweis, and not "blackness"), as well as F, a letter arbitrarily chosen to indicate midway between HB and H. (It is a persistent myth that F stands for fine; F pencils are no more fine or easily sharpened than any other grade.) The standard writing pencil is graded HB.
