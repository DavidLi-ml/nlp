When ECW Champion Bobby Lashley was drafted to Raw and stripped of the ECW Championship, a tournament to declare a new champion was held, with Punk, Elijah Burke, Marcus Cor Von and Chris Benoit. Punk defeated Marcus Cor Von on the June 19 ECW on Sci Fi. He was meant to face Chris Benoit at Vengeance: Night of Champions for the ECW Championship, but Benoit was hastily replaced by Johnny Nitro when Benoit no-showed, after killing his family and self. Nitro subsequently defeated Punk at Vengeance for the vacant championship. Punk won another shot at the title at The Great American Bash against Nitro, who had changed his moniker to John Morrison by this point; however, Punk was defeated again by Morrison. The next week, Punk challenged Elijah Burke and Tommy Dreamer in a triple threat match to determine the next competitor in Morrison's 15 Minutes of Fame Challenge, in which Punk came out victorious. A week later, Punk defeated Morrison with the Go To Sleep to earn an ECW Championship title match at SummerSlam. At SummerSlam, however, Punk lost the match when Morrison used the ropes for leverage.
