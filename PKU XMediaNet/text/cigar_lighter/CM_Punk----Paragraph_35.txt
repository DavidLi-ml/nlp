Punk then used the group to attack Randy Orton, blaming him for prematurely ending Punk's first World Heavyweight Championship reign in 2008. Punk and The Nexus cost Orton his match with The Miz for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble in January 2011. Orton, in turn, responded by taking out all of the New Nexus members by punting them in the head, leaving Punk alone as the sole surviving member of the group. This all led to a WrestleMania XXVII match and a Last Man Standing match at Extreme Rules both of which Punk lost. Punk then spent the next few months involved in filler feuds, often teaming with fellow Nexus members.
