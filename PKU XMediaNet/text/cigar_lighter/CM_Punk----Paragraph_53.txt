A few days after Punk left WWE, his then-fianc√©, April Mendez (AJ Lee), convinced him to get the infection checked by her doctor in Tampa. The doctor, Bateman, not knowing who Punk was or of his medical history, took one look at the lump and diagnosed it as a full-blown MRSA infection and told Punk he could have died due to ignoring it for such a long time. Opting out of going to the hospital for an IV drip, Punk had the doctor get everything out of the infection, describing getting it cut and squeezed out as "the most painful experience of my entire life", but said that once it was all out and he was on stronger medication, he was able to sleep better than he had in weeks.
