On June 23, Punk was drafted to the Raw brand during the 2008 WWE draft. His first night on Raw came the following week; after Batista beat down World Heavyweight Champion Edge, Punk cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and won the World Heavyweight Championship (and later, the Slammy Award for the "Oh my God" Moment of the Year.). Later that night, Punk made his first title defense against JBL, who had challenged him shortly after his win. Punk continued to hold and defend the title until Unforgiven on September 7. Before the Championship Scramble match, Punk was attacked by The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase with Manu). Orton finished the assault by punting Punk in the head. Punk could not participate in the match due to the attack and so forfeited the title. He was replaced by Chris Jericho, who won the match and the title. He received a rematch eight days later on the September 15 Raw, where he failed to regain the title in a steel cage match against Jericho.
