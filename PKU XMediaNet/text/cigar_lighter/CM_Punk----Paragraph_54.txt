Other sources of unhappiness Punk had with WWE were his failure to main-event a WrestleMania (deeming his entire career to be a failure as a result), being paid less than other top wrestlers for WrestleMania 29, doing favors for Vince McMahon (turning heel while champion, working dangerous matches with Ryback, and working with part-time wrestlers) and not being owed back, being "creatively stifled" and feeling that there were no long-term plans for wrestlers other than John Cena, as well as receiving smaller paychecks and not getting answers as to how the WWE Network would affect wrestlers' salaries. Lastly, Punk described having left with "zero passion" for wrestling, and described himself at the time of the interview to be the happiest in many years.
