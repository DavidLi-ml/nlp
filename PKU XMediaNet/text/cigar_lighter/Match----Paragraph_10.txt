This approach to match making was refined in the following decades, culminating with the 'Promethean Match', patented by Samuel Jones of London in 1828. His match consisted of a small glass capsule containing a chemical composition of sulfuric acid coloured with indigo and coated on the exterior with potassium chlorate, wrapped up in a roll of paper. Immediate ignition was caused by crushing the capsule with a pair of pliers.
