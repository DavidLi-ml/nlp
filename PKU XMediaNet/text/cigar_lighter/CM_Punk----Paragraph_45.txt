Punk set his sights on ending The Undertaker's WrestleMania streak on the March 4 Raw, in an effort to "take something away from the fans", as he believed they had taken the WWE title away from him. Punk subsequently defeated Big Show, Randy Orton, and Sheamus in a four-way match to earn the right to face Undertaker. After the real-life death of Paul Bearer the following day, a storyline involving Punk regularly spiting The Undertaker through displays of flippancy and disrespect towards Bearer's death began. Punk interrupted The Undertaker's ceremony to honor Bearer on Raw, stealing his trademark urn and later using it to attack Kane, humiliate The Brothers of Destruction, and mock Bearer. On April 7 at WrestleMania 29, Punk was defeated by The Undertaker who, in the process, extended his streak to 21â€“0 and took back the urn. On the April 15 Raw, Punk addressed the crowd and after briefly recalling his historic championship reign, walked out of the arena.
