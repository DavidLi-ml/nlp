On January 27 at the Royal Rumble, Punk defended the WWE Championship against The Rock in a match with the stipulation that if The Shield interfered, Punk would be stripped of the title. Punk originally pinned The Rock to retain after The Shield put Rock through a table while the arena lights were out. Vince McMahon began to announce that Punk would be stripped of the title, but he instead restarted the match at The Rock's request. Punk went on to lose the match, ending his record-setting reign at 434 days. Punk received a title rematch with Rock on February 17 at the Elimination Chamber event, with the stipulation that the Rock would lose the WWE Championship if he was disqualified or counted out, but Rock pinned Punk to retain the title. On the February 25 Raw, Punk faced Royal Rumble winner John Cena for his number one contendership to the WWE Championship, but was defeated.
