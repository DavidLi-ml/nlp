In coastal regions of the United Kingdom, the beached hulls of old boats and ships have been used as homes in the past, for example, Peggotty's houseboat of the 1840s in the novel David Copperfield. Today in the very same area (Hoo Peninsula) there are hundreds of converted ships, barges and other boats being used as homes by many families.
