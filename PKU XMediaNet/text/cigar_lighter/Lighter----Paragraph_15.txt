Many advertised so-called flameless lighters are not flameless at all, but the flame is invisible (such as a windproof lighter). If a piece of paper can easily be ignited, it is probably not a true flameless lighter and certainly not safe in hazardous environments where smoking is confined to specific safe areas.
