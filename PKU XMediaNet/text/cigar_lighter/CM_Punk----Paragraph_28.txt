On April 13, 2009 during the 2009 WWE draft, Punk was drafted from Raw to SmackDown. In the period after the draft, Punk feuded with Umaga over Umaga's repeated surprise attacks while Punk was attempting to cash in his Money in the Bank contract. This ultimately resulted in a Samoan strap match at Extreme Rules, which was won by Punk.
