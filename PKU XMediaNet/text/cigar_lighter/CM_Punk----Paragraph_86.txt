On February 19, 2015, Christopher M. Amann, the WWE doctor who Brooks alleges misdiagnosed his staph infection and mistreated his concussion, filed a lawsuit against Brooks and Scott Colton (Colt Cabana) for defamation and invasion of privacy. He is seeking $1 million in compensation from each defendant and an undisclosed amount in punitive damages. WWE issued a statement and video in support of Amann, stating that Brooks had never informed anyone at WWE of his staph infection.
