Punk then moved on to feud with the Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper and Erick Rowan), forming an alliance with former rival Daniel Bryan. At Survivor Series, Punk and Bryan defeated Harper and Rowan in a tag team match. After Bryan was "abducted" by the Wyatt Family the following night on Raw, Punk was attacked by former allies The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns). The following week on Raw, Kane announced that Punk would face The Shield in a 3-on-1 handicap match at TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs, which Punk won after Reigns accidentally speared Ambrose.
