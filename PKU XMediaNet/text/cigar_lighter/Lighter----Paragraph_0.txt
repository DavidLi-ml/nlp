A lighter is a portable device used to create a flame, and to ignite a variety of combustible materials, such as a cigar, gas stove, fireworks, candle, or cigarette. It consists of metal or plastic container filled with a flammable fluid or pressurized liquid gas, a means of ignition to produce the flame, and some provision for extinguishing the flame. Alternatively, a lighter can be powered by electricity, using an electric arc or heating element to ignite the target.
