For many years, it was a mystery as to where this bird breeds because no coastal colonies had been identified. However, in the 1970s, it was discovered that it bred in the Atacama Desert in the interior of Chile. This hot and arid environment has few predators and may be relatively safe for the breeding gulls. The site chosen for the nest, a scrape in the sand and often near rocks, is a waterless region some 35 to 100 km (22 to 62 mi) from the coast. Once the eggs hatch, the parents take it in turn to make the round trip to the sea to bring food and water to their offspring.
