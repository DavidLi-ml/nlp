However the bird must be considered as social bird that dislikes being alone, and fights mainly occur over food or in order to protect their eggs and chicks. If 3–4 birds discover a piece of food, the first one to land by the food piece often fold their wings out (together with a sound) in order to proclaim that this piece of food is mine. This is very often opposed by another gull, and during a short fight a third bird may very well grab the piece of food that the two other birds argue about! However, if much food is found especially at a "dangerous location" (like in a backyard of 4–5 floor buildings) the bird who discovered the food then shouts on close-by gulls – and the gulls (also of other species) gather, and when the first bird dares to land in the "difficult to escape location", soon all others feel safe to land, and eat. If a lot of food is located at a more safe location, the gull who first discovers it also shouts on other gulls, but starts to eat without waiting for the arrival of others. The conclusion is that if there is more food than one bird can manage to eat at one time, the birds are helping each other.
