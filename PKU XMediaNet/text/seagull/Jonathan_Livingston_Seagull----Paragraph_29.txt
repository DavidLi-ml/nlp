One major bright spot surrounding the motion picture was the Grammy Award-winning soundtrack album, composed by Neil Diamond and produced by Tom Catalano. It won the 1974 Grammy Award as Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or a Television Special. The album apparently also made more money than the film. The album sold two million copies in the United States, 400,000 in France, 250,000 in Germany, 200,000 in Canada  and 100,000 in the United Kingdom.
