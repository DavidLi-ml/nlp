Two to four eggs, usually three, are laid on the ground or cliff ledges in colonies, and are defended vigorously by this large gull. The eggs are a dark blotched, olive colour. They are incubated for 28â€“30 days. Breeding colonies are predated by great black-backed gulls, harriers, corvids, herons and raccoons.
