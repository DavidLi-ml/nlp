Flushing non-biodegradable waste items down the toilet such as cigarette butts, cotton buds/swabs or menstrual hygiene products (e.g. sanitary napkins or tampons) and condoms can cause a septic tank to clog and fill rapidly. Therefore, these materials should not be disposed of in that manner; the same applies when the toilet is connected to a sanitary sewer instead of a septic tank.
