Several options for dealing with the mosquito issue are: 1. Flushing ALL water once a week 2. Using a small amount of cooking oil to suffocate the larvae (the water is still ok for landscape use after this) 3. Adding the bacillus Bt to the water. This bacteria will not harm animals. 4. Adding mosquito eating fish
