In areas with high population density, groundwater pollution beyond acceptable limits may occur. Some small towns are experiencing the costs of building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, owing to the high cost of extended collection systems. To reduce residential development which might increase the demand to construct an expensive centralized sewerage system, building moratoriums and limits on the subdivision of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a primary remediation strategy as population density increases.
