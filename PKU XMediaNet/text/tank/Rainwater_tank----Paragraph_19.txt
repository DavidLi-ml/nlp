One method of harvesting rain water has been is modular, scalable systems which are installable underground. These came as an evolution of a geosynthetic applications called Infiltration Tanks, which when stacked provide a void space volume which allows for the storing of water. Improved and more cost effective industrial design now allow for theoretically limitless storage of water underground. Examples of these modular structures are Atlantis Matrix Tanks used in the Manly Stormwater Treatment and Re-use project of Manly Council in Australia.
