Although the eyes of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind. Microbats use vision to navigate, especially for long distances when beyond the range of echolocation, and species that are gleanersâ€”that is, ones that attempt to swoop down from above to ambush insects, like crickets on the ground or moths up a tree,often have eyesight about as good as a rat's. Some species have been shown to be able to detect ultraviolet light and most cave-dwelling species have developed the ability to utilize very dim light. They also have high-quality senses of smell and hearing. Bats hunt at night, reducing competition with birds, minimizing contact with certain predators, and travel large distances (up to 800 km) in their search for food.
