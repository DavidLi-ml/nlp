Horseshoe bats are closely related to the family Hipposideridae, which is often included within the Rhinolophidae; however, it is now considered a separate family. In addition to the sole living genus, Rhinolophus, the family Rhinolophidae contains one extinct genus, Palaeonycteris. Many species are extremely difficult to distinguish.
