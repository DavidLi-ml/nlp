All horseshoe bats have leaf-like, horseshoe-shaped protuberances on their noses. In the related Hipposideridae, these protuberances are leaf- or spear-like. They emit echolocation calls through these structures, which may serve to focus the sound. Their hind limbs are not well developed, so they cannot walk on all fours; conversely, their wings are broad, making their flight particularly agile. Most rhinolophids are dull brown or reddish-brown in color. They vary in size from 2.5 to 14 cm in head-body length, and 4.0 to 120 g in weight. Their dental formula is 1.1.1-2.32.1.2-3.3.
