More recently, a comprehensive theory of ice friction, which takes into account all the above-mentioned friction mechanisms, has been presented. This model allows quantitative estimation of the friction coefficient of ice against various materials as a function of temperature and sliding speed. In typical conditions related to winter sports and tires of a vehicle on ice, melting of a thin ice layer due to the frictional heating is the primary reason for the slipperiness.
