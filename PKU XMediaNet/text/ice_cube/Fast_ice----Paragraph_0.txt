Fast ice (also called land-fast ice, landfast ice, and shore-fast ice) is sea ice that is 'fastened' to the coastline, to the sea floor along shoals or to grounded icebergs. Fast ice may either grow in place from the sea water or by freezing pieces of drifting ice to the shore or other anchor sites. Unlike drift (or pack) ice, fast ice does not move with currents and winds.
