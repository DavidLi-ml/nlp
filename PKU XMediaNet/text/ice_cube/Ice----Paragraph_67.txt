Subjected to higher pressures and varying temperatures, ice can form in 16 separate known phases. With care, all these phases except ice X can be recovered at ambient pressure and low temperature in metastable form. The types are differentiated by their crystalline structure, proton ordering and density. There are also two metastable phases of ice under pressure, both fully hydrogen-disordered; these are IV and XII. Ice XII was discovered in 1996. In 2006, XIII and XIV were discovered. Ices XI, XIII, and XIV are hydrogen-ordered forms of ices Ih, V, and XII respectively. In 2009, ice XV was found at extremely high pressures and −143 °C. At even higher pressures, ice is predicted to become a metal; this has been variously estimated to occur at 1.55 TPa or 5.62 TPa.
