Some contamination has been detected in ice cores. The levels of lead on the outside of ice cores is much higher than on the inside.[12] In ice from the Vostok core (Antarctica), the outer portion of the cores have up to 3 and 2 orders of magnitude higher bacterial density and dissolved organic carbon than the inner portion of the cores, respectively, as a result of drilling and handling.[13]
