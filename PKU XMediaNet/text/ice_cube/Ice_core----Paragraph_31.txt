Several techniques have been examined. Cores obtained by hot water drilling at Siple Dome in 1997â€“1998 underwent appreciably more relaxation than cores obtained with the PICO electro-mechanical drill. In addition, the fact that cores were allowed to remain at the surface at elevated temperature for several days likely promoted the onset of rapid relaxation.[9]
