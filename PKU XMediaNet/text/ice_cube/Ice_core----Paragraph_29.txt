Decompression causes significant volume expansion (called relaxation) due to microcracking and the exsolving of enclathratized gases.[6] Relaxation may last for months.[7] During this time, ice cores are stored below -10 °C to prevent cracking due to expansion at higher temperatures. At drilling sites, a relaxation area is often built within existing ice at a depth which allows ice core storage at temperatures below -20 °C.
