The production of amorphous ice hinges on the fast rate of cooling. Liquid water must be cooled to its glass transition temperature (about 136 K or −137 °C) in milliseconds to prevent the spontaneous nucleation of crystals. This is analogous to the production of ice cream from heterogeneous ingredients, which must also be frozen quickly to prevent the growth of crystals in the mixture.
