As porous snow consolidates into ice, the air within it is trapped in bubbles. This process continuously preserves samples of the atmosphere.[14] In order to retrieve these natural samples the ice is ground at low temperatures, allowing the trapped air to escape. It is then condensed for analysis by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry, revealing gas concentrations and their isotopic composition respectively. Apart from the intrinsic importance of knowing relative gas concentrations (e.g. to estimate the extent of greenhouse warming), their isotopic composition can provide information on the sources of gases. For example, CO2 from fossil-fuel or biomass burning is relatively depleted in 13C. See Friedli et al., 1986.
