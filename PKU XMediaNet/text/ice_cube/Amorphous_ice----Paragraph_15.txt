Amorphous ice can be separated from crystalline ice based on its near-infrared and infrared spectrum. At near-IR wavelengths, the characteristics of the 1.65, 3.1, and 4.53 µm water absorption lines are dependent on the ice temperature and crystal order. The peak strength of the 1.65 µm band as well as the structure of the 3.1 µm band are particularly useful in identifying the crystallinity of water ice.
