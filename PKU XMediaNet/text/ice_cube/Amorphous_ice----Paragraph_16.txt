At longer IR wavelengths, amorphous and crystalline ice have characteristically different absorption bands at 44 and 62 µm in that the crystalline ice has significant absorption at 62 µm while amorphous ice does not. In addition, these bands can be used as a temperature indicator at very low temperatures where other indicators (such as the 3.1 and 12 µm bands) fail. This is useful studying ice in the interstellar medium and circumstellar disks. However, observing these features is difficult because the atmosphere is opaque at these wavelengths, requiring the use of space-based infrared observatories.
