In the steam locomotive era, two measures of locomotive performance were generally applied. At first, locomotives were rated by tractive effort. This can be roughly calculated by multiplying the total piston area by 85% of the boiler pressure (a rule of thumb reflecting the slightly lower pressure in the steam chest above the cylinder) and dividing by the ratio of the driver diameter over the piston stroke. However, the precise formula is:
