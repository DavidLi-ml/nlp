Electrified routes in India use 25 kV AC railway electrification at 50 Hz. Until 2013-2014, the Mumbai area used the older 1500 V DC electrification. Dual-current WCAM locomotives were used in Mumbai sections which could use both types of power supply; these locomotives still exist but now use only AC power. As of 2015, Indian railways haul 85% of freight and passenger traffic with electric locomotives.
