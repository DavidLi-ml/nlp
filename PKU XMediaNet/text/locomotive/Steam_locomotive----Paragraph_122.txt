Diesel locomotives began to appear in mainline service in the United States in the mid-1930s. The diesel reduced maintenance costs dramatically, while increasing locomotive availability. On the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad the new units delivered over 350,000 miles (560,000 km) a year, compared with about 120,000â€“150,000 for a mainline steam locomotive. World War II delayed dieselisation in the U.S. The Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad was the first large mainline railroad to convert to all Diesel locomotives in 1949 and Life magazine ran an article Dec 5, 1949 subtitled The GM&O puts all its steam engines to torch, becomes first major U.S. railroad to dieselize 100%. The pace picked up in the 1950s. The last steam locomotive manufactured for general service was a Norfolk and Western 0-8-0, built in its Roanoke shops in December, 1953. 1960 is normally considered the last year for regular Class 1 main line standard gauge steam operations in the United States, with operations on the Grand Trunk Western, Illinois Central, Norfolk and Western, and Duluth Missabe and Iron Range Railroads, as well as Canadian Pacific operations in the state of Maine.
