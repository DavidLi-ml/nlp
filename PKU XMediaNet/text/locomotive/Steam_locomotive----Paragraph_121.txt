The reciprocating mechanism on the driving wheels of a two-cylinder single expansion steam locomotive tended to pound the rails (see "hammer blow"), thus requiring more maintenance. Raising steam from coal took a matter of hours which brought serious pollution problems. Coal-burning locomotives required fire cleaning and ash removal between turns of duty. Diesel or electric locomotives, by comparison, drew benefit from new custom built servicing facilities. Finally, the smoke from steam locomotives was deemed objectionable; in fact, the first electric and diesel locomotives were developed to meet smoke abatement requirements, although this did not take into account the high level of less visible pollution in diesel exhaust smoke, especially when idling. It should also be remembered that the power for electric trains is, for the most part in some countries, derived from steam generated in a power stationâ€”often fueled with coal, though with significantly higher efficiency.
