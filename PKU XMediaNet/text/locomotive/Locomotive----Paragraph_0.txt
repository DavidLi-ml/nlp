A locomotive or engine is a rail transport vehicle that provides the motive power for a train. The word originates from the Latin loco â€“ "from a place", ablative of locus, "place" + Medieval Latin motivus, "causing motion", and is a shortened form of the term locomotive engine, first used in the early 19th century to distinguish between mobile and stationary steam engines.
