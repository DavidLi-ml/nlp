The chief disadvantage of electrification is the cost for infrastructure: overhead lines or third rail, substations, and control systems. Public policy in the U.S. interferes with electrification: higher property taxes are imposed on privately owned rail facilities if they are electrified. U.S. regulations on diesel locomotives are very weak compared to regulations on automobile emissions or power plant emissions.
