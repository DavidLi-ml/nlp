The heat source, contained within the firebox, is the energy released by the combustion, typically of a solid or liquid fuel, with the by-product of hot combustion gases. If wood, coal or coke is used as the combustion material it is introduced through a door, typically by a fireman, onto a set of grates where ashes fall away from the burning fuel. If oil is used a door provides for adjusting the air flow, maintenance or for cleaning the oil jets.
