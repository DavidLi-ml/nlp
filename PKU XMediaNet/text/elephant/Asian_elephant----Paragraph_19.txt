In Bangladesh, some isolated populations survive in the south east Chittagong Hills. A herd of 20-25 wild elephants was reported as being present in the Garo Hills of Mymensingh in the late 1990s, being detached from a big herd in the Peack hills of India and prevented from returning by fences put up in the meantime by the Indian border security force. The herd was estimated at about 60 individuals in 2014.
