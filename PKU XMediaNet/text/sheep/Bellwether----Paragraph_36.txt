The Redskins Rule is thought by some to predict the Presidential election. In a peculiar coincidence, from the time the Washington Redskins arrived in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in 1937 until 2000, the last Redskins home game before each Election Day accurately determined the incumbent party's fate in that year's presidential election. The rule was not accurate in 2004 or 2012.
