In the United Kingdom, the Dartford constituency has reflected the overall result in every General Election since 1964, the Basildon constituency has reflected every result since its creation in 1974 and the Loughborough constituency has elected an MP to the governing party since the February 1974 election. Gravesham and its predecessor Gravesend had a perfect record of voting for the winning party or the one with the largest share of the vote in every election from the First World War except for 2005, when they voted Conservative with Labour winning the election. Bristol North West is also considered something of a bellwether, with its voters having elected the candidate of the winning party in every election since October 1974, though it failed to do so on a number of occasions prior to this.
