The Cheviot is a breed of white faced sheep which gets its name from a range of hills in north Northumberland and the Scottish Borders. It is still common in this area of the United Kingdom, but also in north west Scotland, Wales and the south west of England (especially Dartmoor and Exmoor) as well as more rarely in Australia, New Zealand and the United States. The Cheviot is a dual-purpose breed being raised primarily for meat and wool.
