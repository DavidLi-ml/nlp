Sheep have had a strong presence in many cultures, especially in areas where they form the most common type of livestock. In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led. In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; the logos of the St. Louis Rams and the Dodge Ram allude to males of the bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis.
