In 1999 the population was estimated to be at less than 84, with 74 ewes. In 2002, there were between 92 and 100 animals, with 92 ewes and the male population estimated to be less than 7. In 2012, 204 ewes were registered in herdbooks. According to the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, there are fewer than 300-500 sheep in the UK, so they are classed as "Category 2: Endangered". They are the only breed in this category, and therefore the rarest breed of sheep in the United Kingdom.
