The Hog Island sheep is a feral breed, descended from sheep abandoned on Hog Island in the 1930s and 1940s. It is believed that the breed was descended from the Merino breed, among others, possibly the Improved Leicester or other English breeds. The sheep is relatively small but tough and hardy. Rams weigh on average 125 pounds (57 kg) and ewes 90 pounds (41 kg). Lambs are born with spotted or speckled fleece; about 90% of adults have white fleece and 10% black. Both males and females can have horns, and about half the total population do.
