The Boreray should not be confused with the Soay sheep, also from the St Kilda archipelago, nor with the Hebridean sheep, which was formerly called the "St Kilda", although it is probably not in fact derived from the St Kilda sheep. Soay sheep are smaller than Boreray sheep, their ewes weighing between 20 and 23 kg. Their fleece is normally black, opposed to the white or tan of the Boreray. The Boreray is also known by the names Boreray Blackface and Hebridean Blackface.
