20-gauge shotguns are especially suitable for hunting game birds such as quail, grouse, turkey, and other small game when using shot shells. A 20-gauge can also shoot slugs and thereby become an effective deer-hunting gun. 20-gauge shotguns loaded with slugs are usually less accurate than rifles, but they often have better stopping power at short rangeâ€”although this depends on the amount of gunpowder in the shell's load.
