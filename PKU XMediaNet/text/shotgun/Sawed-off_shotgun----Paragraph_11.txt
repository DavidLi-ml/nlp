Within the United Kingdom, side-by-side, over-under, bolt action and lever action shotguns are required to conform to the specification of a 24" minimum barrel length if held on a shotgun certificate. If held on a firearms certificate (the applicant having demonstrated 'good reason' for possession), they must comply with the standard configuration of 12" minimum barrel length, 24" minimum overall length, common with other Section 1 firearms.
