For example, the Brown Bess musket, in service with the British army from 1722 to 1838, had a 19 mm (.75 inch) smoothbore barrel, roughly the same as a 10 gauge shotgun, and was 157 cm (62 in) long, just short of the above recommended 168 cm (51⁄2 feet). On the other hand, records from the Plymouth colony show a maximum length of 137 cm (41⁄2 feet) for fowling pieces, shorter than the typical musket.
