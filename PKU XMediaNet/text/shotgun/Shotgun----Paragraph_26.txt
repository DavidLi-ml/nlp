A sawed-off shotgun (or "sawn-off") refers to a shotgun whose barrel has been shortened, leaving it more maneuverable, easier to use at short range and more readily concealed. Many countries establish a legal minimum barrel length that precludes easy concealment (this length is 18 inches (460 mm) in the U.S. and 24 inches in the UK). The sawed-off shotgun is sometimes known as a "Lupara" (in Italian a generic reference to the word "lupo" ("wolf")) in Southern Italy and Sicily.
