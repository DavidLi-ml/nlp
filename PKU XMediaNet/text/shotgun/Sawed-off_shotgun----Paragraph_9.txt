In Germany, the possession of a sawed-off shotgun is legal with a firearms license (Waffenbesitzkarte), just like any other firearm. Restrictions only apply to pump-action shotguns, which require a minimum barrel length of 45cm and a minimum overall length of 90cm to be legal. These restrictions only apply to pump-action shotguns, all others are legal to possess in any length. If the barrel length is less than 30cm or the overall length is less than 60cm, the firearm is considered a handgun, and treated accordingly under the law.
