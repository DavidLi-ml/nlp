In addition, 20-gauge shotguns often have less recoil than 10, 12 or 16-gauge versions on average, and may be more desirable to those who want to experience less recoil for prolonged shooting. The lower recoil also makes a 20-gauge appropriate for younger (or conversely, elderly) shooters who may have a difficult time firing a larger shotgun. However, recoil is largely dependent on the weight of the gun itself; for instance, a 4.5 pound 20-gauge can have more recoil than an eight-pound 12-gauge. This is widely considered a flaw in the design of so-called 'youth' guns.
