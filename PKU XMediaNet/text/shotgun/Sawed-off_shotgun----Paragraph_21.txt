The primary reason that the pattern is altered is because cutting off the end of the barrel removes the choke, which generally only extends about two inches (about 5 cm) inward from the muzzle. This results in a cylinder bore, which causes the widest spread generally found in shotgun barrels. (See choke for more information on the impact of chokes. See shotgun shell for information on spreader loads.) See details on shot patterning.
