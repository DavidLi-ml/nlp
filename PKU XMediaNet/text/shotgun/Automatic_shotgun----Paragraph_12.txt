Automatic shotguns are intended for use as military combat shotguns. They typically have a high rate of fire and relatively low recoil, making them ideal for engaging multiple targets in a fast paced combat situation. They are able to fulfill several different combat roles, due to the wide variety of shotgun ammunition available. A single gun can be used to breach a door, clear a room, provide support with special grenade rounds, or even suppress a riot with some less-lethal rounds.
