Note: In Australia, this is different. The refrigerator rule applies (you can't stand in a fridge, the door always opens towards you) – If the hinges are on the left then it is a left hand (or left hung) door. If the hinges are on the right then it is a right hand (or right hung) door. See the Australian Standards for Installation of Timber Doorsets, AS 1909–1984 pg 6.
