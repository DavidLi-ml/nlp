Evolution Door is a trackless door that moves in the same closure level as a sliding door. The system is an invention of the Austrian artist Klemens Torggler. From the technical point of view the Evolution Door is a further development (evolution) of the Drehplattent√ºr or flip panel door that normally consists of two rotatable, connected panels which move to each other when opening.
