Owning a handgun in Germany is legal with a firearm ownership license (Waffenbesitzkarte). The license is shall-issue for applicants who have met all requirements for it, which include a clean criminal background, proof of purchase of a gun safe, passing a test about handling and laws regarding firearms, and providing a genuine reason for owning the gun. While self-defence is usually not accepted as a valid cause for gun ownership, sports shooting, having a hunting license and collecting, are. Handguns with a caliber of less than 6,3 mm are banned, except those built for rimfire ammunition and those built before January 1, 1970. Carrying a handgun (and any other firearm) is legal with a firearm carrying permit (Waffenschein). It is only issued when the applicant shows exceptionally good reason why they are in danger (Politicians, businessmen, etc..).
