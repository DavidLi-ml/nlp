Semi-automatic pistols with different traits have been designed, including those with a magazine fed with a stripper clip, and those with nonremovable magazines. These designs are rarely used in modern semi-automatic pistols. The Model C96, or "Broomhandle" Mauser, in its original configuration, has a fixed, nonremovable magazine located in front of the trigger, which is loaded directly through the breech from the top of the pistol.
