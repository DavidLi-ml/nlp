In Belgium in 1896, the first American gun designer to develop self-loading semi-automatic pistols was John Browning, whose models were first manufactured by the Belgian firm of Fabrique Nationale (FN) in Europe and later by Colt in the U.S. Like Luger's work conducted around the same time in Germany, Browning's first successful design was in 7.65 mm, the Browning M1900. Browning also devised a slightly different 7.65 mm Browning (.32 Auto) cartridge for his semi-automatic pistol that differed from Luger's 7.65 mm Parabellum. Browning also designed .25, .38, .380, and .45 ACP cartridges in addition to .32 ACP for his semi-automatic pistol designs.
