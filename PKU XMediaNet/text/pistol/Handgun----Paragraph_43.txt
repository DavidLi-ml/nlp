In the United Kingdom (with the exception of Northern Ireland), possession of almost any handgun by most civilians has been outlawed since the Dunblane massacre of 1996; the only exclusions were single-shot, rimfire, and muzzleloading pistols/revolvers. So called "long barreled" cartridge-firing revolvers and semiautomatic pistols (.22LR only) are still legal providing that they meet the following requirements: overall length not less than 24 inches, barrel length not less than 12 inches. As with all other legal firearms in the UK, possession requires a Firearm Certificate. The application and vetting process is carried out by the local police force and is very in depth. Good reason (justification) for holding a firearm certificate in the UK would be target shooting (as part of a Home Office Approved Club) or hunting. "Self-defence" or other reasons of this nature are not allowed. The open carrying of any firearm in a public place is illegal in the UK unless you have a valid reason to do so, this also requires that you carry it in a gun carry case. Concealed carry of any firearm in a public place would normally be illegal, unless authorised by a firearms licence. Air pistols are still legal, however, those with energy levels over 6 foot pounds (8 joules) (half the limit for air rifles, which is 12 foot pound or 16.25 joules) are classified as firearms.
