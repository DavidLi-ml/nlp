Unlike the Luger, the Mauser C96 pistol was modified to fire in a fully automatic mode. It was produced in 1896, and was one of the first commercially successful and practical semi-automatic pistols. In the late 1920s, Spanish gunmakers introduced "selective fire" copies of the C96 with detachable magazines, and in the early 1930s Mauser engineers introduced the model 711 and 712 Schnellfeuer variants, which included a fire selector mechanism allowing fully automatic fire at a rate of 1000 rounds/minute. Due to the weapon's light barrel, the fully automatic rate of fire could only be used for short bursts.
