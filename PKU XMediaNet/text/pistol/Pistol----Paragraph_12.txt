The Liberator is a physible, 3D-printable single shot handgun, the first such printable firearm design made widely available online. The open source firm Defense Distributed designed the gun and released the plans on the Internet on 6 May 2013. The plans were downloaded over 100,000 times in the two days before the US Department of State demanded Defense Distributed retract the plans.
