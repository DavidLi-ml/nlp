Using a more powerful and nearly identical version of the 7.63 mm bottle necked cartridge of the Borchardt C-93 Pistol, the Mauser was one of the first self-loading pistols used extensively in battle, notably the South African War of 1899-1902. These pistols were made in 7.63 mm Mauser, or 9Ã—25 mm Mauser, along with some models eventually being made in 9 mm Parabellum and a small number in .45 ACP for China.
