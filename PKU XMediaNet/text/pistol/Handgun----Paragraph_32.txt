Civilian ownership of handguns in Australia is legal, but heavily restricted. Handguns may not be owned for self-defense purposes (Target shooting, collecting, and occupational reasons for farmers/gun dealers are, by and large, the only legal reasons for handgun ownership), and anyone wishing to possess a handgun must obtain a firearms license and observe stringent storage regulations. Calibre for handguns is limited to .38; however, calibres up to .45 may be obtained with a permit for certain disciplines such as Metallic Silhouette. Minimum barrel lengths are imposed for handguns with 4" for Revolvers and 4.72"(120 mm) for Semi-Automatic Pistols. Pistol magazines with a capacity of over 10 rounds are restricted to collectors, security guards and firearms dealers.
