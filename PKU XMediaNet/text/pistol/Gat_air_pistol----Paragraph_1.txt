The Gat was produced from the late 1930s to the mid 1990s by T J Harrington & Co Ltd. of Magda Works, Walton on Thames, Surrey. There was a break in production during WWII, resuming shortly afterwards. Production finally ended with the death of Mr Harrington, increasing overseas competition and a declining public interest in 'nasty bits of machinery'.
