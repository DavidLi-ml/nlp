In comparison to long guns (rifles and shotguns), handguns are smaller, lighter, and easier to carry. Since firearms do not rely entirely on the user's strength, they put weaker individuals on an equal footing; when Colt produced the first practical repeating handgun, it gave rise to the saying "God created men, but Colt made them equal."
