The Lange Pistole 08 (German: "Long Pistol 08") or Artillery Luger was a pistol carbine for use by German Army artillerymen as a sort of early Personal Defense Weapon. It had a 200 mm (7.9 in) barrel, an 8-position tangent rear sight (calibrated to 800 meters (870 yd)) and a shoulder stock with holster. When set for long range use the rear sight element visibly moves to the left to compensate for spin drift. It was sometimes used with a 32-round drum magazine (Trommelmagazin 08). Early issue LP08s had micrometer adjustable front and rear sights which required a 2-pin tool for adjustment. It was also available in various commercial carbine versions with yet longer barrels.
