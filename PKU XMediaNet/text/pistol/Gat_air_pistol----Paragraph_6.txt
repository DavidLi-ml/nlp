Loading is by a screw breech at the rear. The pellet is pushed far down the barrel by a long pin on this breech, until it is past the air port. If the breech pin is lost, the pistol cannot be loaded. A common replacement, given the nature of the pistol's users, was to replace the pin with another screw or other sort of extemporised plug. This does not work, the pellet in some cases even being fired backwards out of the breech.
