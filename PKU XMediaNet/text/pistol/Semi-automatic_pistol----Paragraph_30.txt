After World War II, most nations eventually adopted 9 mm Parabellum caliber pistols employing Browning's locked-breech design for their standard-issue military pistols. The most popular early choice was the FN Browning Hi-Power, which was the first high-capacity pistol; another popular model was the locked-breech Walther P38 because of its many safety features. As of 2011, the U.S. military sidearm is a variant of the Beretta 92F/FS.
