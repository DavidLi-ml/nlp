Many rifles are able to achieve bullet velocities of over 3,000 ft/s (914 m/s), but rounds for handguns are rarely capable of achieving velocities over 1,500 ft/s (457 m/s). Thus, long guns are generally more powerful at any given range, and especially more effective at longer ranges than handguns. Because of the pistol's seemingly low power, many ballistic vest and armor have the capability of stopping pistol bullets. This is largely due to both facts that pistols have shorter barrel, producing a reduced rifling, and the shape of the nose, which also reduces penetration. These problems also apply to submachine guns. Demonstration project armor issued by NIJ was designed to ensure a 95 percent probability of survival after being hit with a .38 caliber and the widely used 9mm bullet at a velocity of 800 ft/s. Furthermore, the probability of requiring surgery if hit by a projectile was to be 10 percent or less.
