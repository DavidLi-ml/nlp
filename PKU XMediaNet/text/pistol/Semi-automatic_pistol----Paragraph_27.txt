Browning also co-designed the FN Browning Hi-Power, announced in 1922, during the last years of his life, working on this design until his death in 1926. It was a 9 mm Luger semi-automatic pistol capable of holding 13 rounds (plus one chambered) in the magazine. The Savage 1907 Pistol in .32 ACP featured a 10-round magazine which is of staggered-column design, and predates the Browning patent filing,[6-28-1923, issued as U.S. patent #1,618,510, dated 22 Feb. 1927] for the large-capacity 9 mm pistol by some 18 years as the Savage was patented in 1905, Whether the staggered magazine featured in the Savage 1905 was a focal point of the patent is unclear. In a review of the Browning patent dated 22 Feb. 1927, it is equally unclear as to the staggered magazine being either a primary or a dependent claim of the patent as issued. However, the existence of a staggered magazine in 1905 is indisputable, as many of these Savage pistols were produced and survive to this day. Browning could well have come into contact with this concept during the military trials of 1911, as a version of the Savage design in .45 cal was also under consideration alongside the Browning/Colt design.) The earlier, single-column magazine design is still used today, however, especially for deep-concealment semi-automatic pistols such as the Kel-Tec P-32.
