In Kenya, private ownership of certain types of firearms and ammunition is legal under the Firearms Act (cap. 114), laws of Kenya. Applicants for a gun ownerâ€™s licence in Kenya are required by law to show genuine reason for wanting to possess a firearm. Reasons such as intention of using the firearm in target shooting, for protection or for personal security are often the ones given by gun license applicants. Anyone as young as 12 can actually apply for gun ownership under the aforementioned Kenyan law. However, an applicant for a firearm licence must pass stringent background checks which consider criminal, mental and domestic violence records before he or she can be permitted to privately own a firearm and ammunition. Where a history or apprehended likelihood of family violence exists, the law stipulates that a gun licence should be denied or revoked hencewith. Additionally, the law further requires that any possession, sale or transfer of a firearm be recorded and retained in a centralised and official register managed by the Kenya Police. Moreover, the firearm regulations in Kenya spell out the written specifications for the lawful safe storage of private firearms and ammunition by all licensed gun owners. The regulations also specicify how such firearms and ammunition may be handled whilst on transit. As for carrying a concealed handgun in a public place, the law does not require one to have a permit to do so.
