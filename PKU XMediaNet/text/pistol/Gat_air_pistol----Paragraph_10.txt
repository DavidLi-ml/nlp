The Gat was constructed cheaply and with little attempt at accuracy. Both frame and barrel were die-cast. In later years, plastic parts appeared in the trigger guard. Being die-cast rather than steel, the pistol was not blued but was painted black. A more expensive version was available in chrome plate, although these were rare.
