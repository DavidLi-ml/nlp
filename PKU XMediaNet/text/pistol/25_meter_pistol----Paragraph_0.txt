25 metre pistol, formerly and unofficially still often known as sport pistol, is one of the ISSF shooting events. It was devised as a women's event in the 1960s, based upon the rules of 25 metre center-fire pistol but shot with a .22-caliber sport pistol instead of the larger-caliber guns men used. As with all ISSF pistol disciplines, all firing must be done with one hand, unsupported.
