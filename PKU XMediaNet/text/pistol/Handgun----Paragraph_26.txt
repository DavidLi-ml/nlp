Another important tactical consideration is maneuverability. In close quarters, an opponent could more easily wrestle a long gun's muzzle to a position where it is not covering him, or could more easily wrestle the gun away from its owner, whereas a handgun offers little to grab, and would be more likely to still be covering some portion of the opponent during the struggle.
