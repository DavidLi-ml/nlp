Browning also created the locked-breech action now commonly used by nearly all heavy-caliber semi-automatic pistols, and designed the .45 ACP Colt M1911, adopted by the U.S. military as its service pistol in 1911. The Model 1911 is still in active use with some U.S. Special Forces and Marine Corps units.
