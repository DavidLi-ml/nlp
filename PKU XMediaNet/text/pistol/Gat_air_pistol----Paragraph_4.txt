A cocked Gat appears to have a fixed circular barrel protruding from a receiver that is also of roughly circular section. When fired, an inner section of the barrel, previously hidden, is driven forward by a spring and so the fired Gat then appears to have a three-section barrel (as illustrated). Cocking is performed by pushing this inner section back into the middle section. The middle 'barrel' is no more than a shroud over the operating spring and was not part of Quackenbush's original patent.
