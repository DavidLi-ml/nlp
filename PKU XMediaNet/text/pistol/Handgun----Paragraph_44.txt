In the United States, it is very easy to obtain a handgun compared to other nations. Federal law states that one must be at least 21 years of age to purchase a handgun or handgun ammunition from a Federal Firearms Dealer. The rules for carrying a handgun in public vary by local jurisdiction. While there are many exceptions, in general open carry is allowed, but concealed carry requires a permit in select states. In 41 states, acquiring such a permit is automatic, assuming the applicant has no criminal record and (in many states) has taken a firearms class. In 8 states and the District of Columbia, issuing such a permit is discretionary; one state, Vermont, does not issue such permits as one is not needed for lawful carry. The states of Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Mississippi, Maine, Kansas, West Virginia and Wyoming also allow permit-less carry, though these states still issue permits for reciprocity with other states. Some states place certain restrictions on who may purchase handguns, and some have waiting periods after purchase, though most do neither, aside for applicants with criminal records. Anyone selling handguns at retail must have a Federal Firearms License, in addition to any local requirements. The U.S. has 90 guns for every 100 people, making it the most heavily armed society in the world.
