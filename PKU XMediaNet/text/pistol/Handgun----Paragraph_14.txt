The next development in handgun history after a practical revolver was the development of the semi-automatic pistol, which uses the energy of one shot to reload the next. Typically recoil energy from a fired round is mechanically harnessed; however, pistols chambered for more powerful cartridges may be gas operated (e.g., Desert Eagle), or for less powerful cartridges, blowback. After a round is fired, the pistol will cycle, ejecting the spent casing and chambering a new round from the magazine, allowing another shot to take place immediately.
