In October 2010 Mackie Academy, in Stonehaven, Kincardineshire took the move to turn off their school bell system, following criticism that the school bells agitated pupils. According to the headteacher the corridors became much quieter after the system was introduced. It was hoped that pupils would take more responsibility for ensuring they arrived on time to lessons. A number of other schools in the United Kingdom have made similar decisions and either partially or completely turned off the school bell system.
