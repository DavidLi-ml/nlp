In some schools, students have been seen interfering school bell systems. While they do not actually hack into the school bell system, they often use a synthesizer application, commonly on a smartphone or tablet, combined with a loudspeaker, to reproduce a sound nearly identical to the real school bell. Students often use this in open areas during lunch as a practical joke to clear large areas of students, or near the end of classtime, to be dismissed earlier. Early attempts at such interference were often seen as outright hacking of school systems, and were thus punished severely.
