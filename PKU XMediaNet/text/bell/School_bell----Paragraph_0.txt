The ringing of a school bell is a signal that tells a school's students when it is time to go to class in the morning and when it is time to change classes during the day as well as when students are dismissed from school. Typically the first bell tells the students that it is time to report to class and the bell that occurs shortly after that means that the students are late. There may also be a warning bell between the first bell and the late bell.
