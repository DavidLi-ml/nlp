The St. Petersglocke, in the local dialect of Cologne also called dä Dicke Pitter ("fat Peter", [ˌdekə.ˈpitˑɐ]), is a bell in Germany's Cologne Cathedral. It weighs 24 tons and was cast in 1922. It is the largest functioning free-swinging bell in the world that swings around the top. (The Gotenba Bell and the World Peace Bell swing around their center of gravity, which is more like turning than swinging. So, depending on the point of view, the St. Petersglocke may be considered up to now the largest free-swinging bell in the world.)
