In the western world, the classical form of bell is a church bell or town bell, which is hung within a tower. Such bells are either fixed in position ("hung dead") or mounted on a beam (the "headstock") so they can swing to and fro. Bells that are hung dead are normally sounded by hitting the sound bow with a hammer or occasionally by pulling an internal clapper against the bell.
