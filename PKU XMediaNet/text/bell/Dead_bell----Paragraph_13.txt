The Loudoun Kirk dead bell still survived in 1894, having originally been sent to the parishioners from Holland by James Campbell, 2nd Earl of Loudoun who died in 1684. It had Loudoun Kirk cast in raised lettering and was used at funeral processions; it was held by Mrs Semple at Loudoun Village in 1875. Loudoun parish church at Newmilns has a deid bell inscribed "Countess of Loudoun." The Kilmarnock example had the town's name and the date "1639" and was preserved in the town hall. The Galston example had the name and the date "1722." The Maybole dead bell had no markings and after being exhibited at the 1911 Glasgow Exhibition it remained in the Kelvingove Museum's collections. A Hawick dead bell is recorded.
