Different bells can have specific sounds to identify important characteristics of the animals, such as age, gender, and species. Some cultures have even developed names to differentiate between bells and their tones; for example, in Spanish "truco" refers to stud males, "esquila" to female goats or ewes, and "esquileta" for pregnant females and immature animals. Each of these bells possess unique sounds, shapes, and sizes.
