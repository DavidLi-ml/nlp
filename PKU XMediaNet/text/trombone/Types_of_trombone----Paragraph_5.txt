The range of the contrabass trombone (excluding fundamentals or pedal notes) demanded by Wagner is from E1 to E4, though composers since then have required even lower notes - even as low as B♭0. Given that the older B♭ contrabass is less common nowadays in professional ensembles, the F contrabass trombonist produces notes below F♯1 as fundamentals, allowing full access to the range of the older B♭ contrabass trombone and extending the range even lower.
