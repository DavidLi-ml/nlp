In recent years, the discovery of new repertoire and emerging information regarding alto trombone soloist Thomas Gshlant in the 18th century has contributed to the idea that (contrary to our previous understanding) the alto trombone enjoyed a period of prosperity between the years 1756-1780. Until recently, little was actually known about trombone repertoire from the 18th century. In the 1960s an incomplete concerto by Wagneseil was recorded by trombone soloist Nicolas Harnoncourt. The Wagneseil Concerto demands extremely rare and advanced skills and technique from the performer and is the first known concerto form work for the trombone.
