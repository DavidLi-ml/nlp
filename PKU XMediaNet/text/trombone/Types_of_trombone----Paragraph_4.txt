Since World War II the contrabass trombone in F with two valve attachments has been primarily in use in orchestras, though the 18' B♭ version is still used by many. Originally due to reasons of limited space conditions in opera orchestra pits, the bell section was provided with a coil to reduce the length of the bell bow, but since the 1970s the long, straight form has taken precedence. Through the combination of both valves the extension handle on the outer slide also became redundant and the instrument is provided with five or six working positions on the slide. Valve tuning combinations are E♭/B♭, D/B♭, or more rarely D/C.
