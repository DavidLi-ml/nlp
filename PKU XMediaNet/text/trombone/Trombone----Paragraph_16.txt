During the later Baroque period, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Friderich Handel used trombones on a few occasions. Bach used it in some of his cantatas, even having written for 4 trombones (with the extremely rare soprano-trombone playing the cantus firmus), which in earlier times would have been played by cornett. Handel used it in the Death March from Saul, Samson, and Israel in Egypt, all of which were examples of a new oratorio style, popular during the early 18th century. Distinct score-notations are rare, since only a few professional "Stadtpfeiffer" or alta cappella musicians were available everywhere. Handel, for instance, had to import trombones to England from a Royal court in Hanover, Germany in order to perform one of his larger compositions. Therefore, trombone-parts were rather seldom given "solo" roles that were not substitutable with other instruments.
