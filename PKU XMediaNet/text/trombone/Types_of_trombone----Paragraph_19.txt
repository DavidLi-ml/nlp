Sattler used the rotary valve attachment to provide a way to play the notes between the fundamental B♭1 (first position) and the second partial E2 (seventh position). The valve allowed players to produce low E♭, D, D♭, C (and, with adjustments, B), thus making the full range of the old bass trombone in 12' F available and extending the chromatic range of the tenor trombone through the fundamentals to E1.
