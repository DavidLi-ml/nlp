Older, now obsolete versions of the bass trombone were of smaller bore than the modern bass trombones described above. They were usually pitched in G, F, or E♭, and had a longer slide with a handle attached to the outer slide stay to allow for full extension of the slide. They were mainly used in Europe and the British Empire. They were sometimes called Terzposaune, Quartposaune, and Quintposaune (from the German name for the intervals third, fourth, and fifth lower than B♭), though sometimes Quartposaune was used generally to refer to any of these.
