Rusty trombone (dirty trombone) gained wider use in entertainment projects being developed for release in 2005. For example, comedian Andy Dick used the term in the 2005 documentary film The Aristocrats as part of the infamous dirty joke of the same name. In seeming recognition of the phrase being a part of the filthiest of filthy language, news sources such as The Daily Telegraph, Slant Magazine, New Statesman, and Globe and Mail highlighted rusty trombone in their review of The Aristocrats. In addition, in the 2005 movie The 40-Year-Old Virgin. the character Mooj stated, "It's not about these rusty trombones, and these dirty sanchez." In the film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, actor Jack Black is seen in walking around the Venice Beach, California boardwalk in a Rusty Trombone T-shirt.
