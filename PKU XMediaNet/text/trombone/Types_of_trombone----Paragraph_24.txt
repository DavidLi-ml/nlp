Shortly after this recording was released, another concerto written by Beethoven's teacher, entitled the "Trombone Concerto" was discovered. However, due to advanced techniques required in this concerto (particularly the lip trills), it was considered too difficult for the trombone and musicologists concluded that it was most likely was written for the French horn instead. New information regarding trombone virtuoso Thomas Gshlant demonstrates that music of this difficulty was in fact written for the alto trombone during the mid to late 18th century and that music we previously thought impossible on the instrument was certainly possible. Like Bach's trumpet soloist Gottfried Reiche and Mozart's horn soloist, Hoseph Leutgeb, Thomas Gshlant represented the very best of contemporary trombone soloists. Gshlant was very close to Leopold Mozart (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's father) and Leopold even wrote a Serenade for Gshlant. In fact, Leopold so admired Gshlant's abilities that he demanded that the Serenade be performed by him alone. When Gshlant was unavailable, Leopold preferred using a viola soloist over another trombonist.
