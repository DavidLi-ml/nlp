The bass ophicleide was first scored for in the opera Olimpie by Gaspare Spontini in 1819. Other famous works which employ it include Felix Mendelssohn's Elias and Overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream (originally scored for English Bass Horn), as well as Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, which was originally scored to include both an ophicleide and a serpent. The instrument was standard in French mid-19th century serious operas by Meyerbeer, Halevy, Saint-SaÃ«ns, and Auber, as well as English operas by Michael Balfe, Vincent Wallace, and others. Verdi and Wagner also composed for the ophicleide as did Sir Arthur Sullivan in his Overture Di Ballo (which, like Wagner's Rienzi, also has an additional part for serpent).
