The Allmusic review by Ken Dryden awarded the album 4 stars stating "The solos on this hard bop disc are superb, with Fuller giving his musicians plenty of room, while his own work is first-rate. Three of the six pieces are originals and even if they never caught on, there is no filler present anywhere".
