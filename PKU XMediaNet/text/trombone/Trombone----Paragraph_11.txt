Some time no later than the middle of the 13th century, towns began to equip watchmen with shawms or trumpets, which they played as signals at night. Early in the 14th century some towns started requiring the watchmen to provide music for civic ceremonies. The normal instrumentation for these early wind bands was two shawms and a trumpet. Shawm technique underwent a dramatic improvement in the middle of the 14th century. The trumpet could play too few notes to keep up. The bands needed an improvement.
