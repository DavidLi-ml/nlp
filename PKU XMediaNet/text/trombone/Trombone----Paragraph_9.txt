During the Renaissance, the equivalent English term was "sackbut." The word first appears in court records in 1495 as "shakbusshe" at about the time King Henry VII married a Portuguese princess who brought some musicians with her. "Shakbusshe" is similar to "sacabuche," attested in Spain as early as 1478. The French equivalent "saqueboute" appears a little earlier.
