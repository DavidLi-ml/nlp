The pedal tone on B♭ is frequently seen in commercial scoring but much less often in symphonic music while notes below that are called for only rarely as they "become increasingly difficult to produce and insecure in quality" with A♭ or G being the bottom limit for most trombonists. However, some contemporary orchestral writing and solos will call for notes as low as a pedal F on the bass trombone.
