As the slide is shorter, the positions are different from the tenor and bass trombone slide positions most players are familiar with. The tone of the alto is more brilliant than that of the tenor or bass trombone. The bore of an alto trombone is similar to that of a small tenor trombone - usually around 0.450 to 0.500 inches (11.4 to 12.7 mm) with a 6.5 or 7 inches (17 or 18 cm) bell.
