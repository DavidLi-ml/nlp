The soprano trombone is usually pitched in B♭ an octave above the tenor and built with a bore size of between 0.450 and 0.470 inches (11.4 and 11.9 mm) and a trumpet-sized bell. It appears to have been created in the late 17th century, from which the earliest surviving examples date. Johann Sebastian Bach composed 4 cantatas, where 4 trombones are required. There is never an exact name for the first trombone part, but it is quite possible written for a "diskant-posaune". It was used in German-speaking countries to play the treble part in chorales, and this tradition survives in Moravian trombone choirs. During the 20th century some soprano trombones—dubbed slide cornets—were made as novelties or for use by jazz cornet players, but the instrument has never been widely used. It is easily replaced by the cornet or woodwind instruments and it is difficult to play in tune. Soprano trombone slides are short and often have only six positions rather than seven. The soprano trombone's high pitch and narrow/tight embouchure usually prompt bandleaders to assign its playing to a trumpeter, albeit at the risk of detriment to intonation and/or note selection accuracy if the trumpeter is less than fully familiar with slide work.
