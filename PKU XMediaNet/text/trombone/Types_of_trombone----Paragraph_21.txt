As the tubing length increases by a factor of one third, the distance between each position must be one third longer when the valve attachment is engaged. This results in only six positions being available, as the slide is too short for what is effectively a bass trombone in 12' F. Because of this, the B two ledger lines below the bass staff is impossible to play unless the attachment is tuned down to E, or the embouchure is loosened. The range of the tenorbass trombone is therefore E1 to Bâ™­1, then C2 to D5.
