According to most musicologists, the trombone developed from the Medieval trumpet in three steps. First trumpet makers rediscovered the ancient technique of bending brass tubes. Two bent sections connecting three straight tubes can result either in an S-shaped instrument, or with more stability, a loop. Second, they discovered how to insert a slightly narrower tube inside the first "yard" of the either of these bent trumpets so that the instrument could slide along it and become longer. It was this form that first received the name "trombone." Third, some maker developed the modern U-shaped slide, in which a pair of straight tubes connected by a bent tube move along the outside of two smaller straight tubes. This form of trombone existed some time before 1490.
