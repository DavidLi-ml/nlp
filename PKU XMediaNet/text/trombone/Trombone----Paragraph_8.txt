"Trombone" is the Italian word tromba (trumpet) plus the suffix â€“one (big). In other words, it means "big trumpet." The word first appears in court records in Ferrara in 1439, when the Latin term tuba ductilis was translated "trombonus vulgo dictus" or "trombone in the vernacular." The length of the trombone's tube was not necessarily longer than that of the trumpet, but it could be made longer by means of the slide. "Trombone" is apparently the first word that explicitly means a slide instrument.
