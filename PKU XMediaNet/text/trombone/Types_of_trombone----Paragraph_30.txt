The alto trombone is primarily used in choral, orchestral and operatic settings, although it has enjoyed a history as a solo instrument, primarily in 18th century Vienna. Modern composers have rediscovered the instrument and the alto trombone has begun making more appearances in modern small-scale compositions like the chamber opera The Burning Fiery Furnace written by Britten in 1966. Today, first-chair professional orchestral tenor trombonists are expected to play the alto trombone when required.
