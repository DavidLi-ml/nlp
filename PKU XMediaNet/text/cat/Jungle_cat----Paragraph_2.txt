The jungle cat is a habitat generalist; it inhabits places with adequate water and dense vegetation, such as swamps, wetlands and riparian areas. Unlike its name, the jungle cat shuns rainforests and woodlands. The jungle cat is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. Major threats to the survival of the jungle cat include the destruction of wetlands, trapping and poisoning. The status of the cat in the wild needs further study, though numbers are feared to be on the decline.
