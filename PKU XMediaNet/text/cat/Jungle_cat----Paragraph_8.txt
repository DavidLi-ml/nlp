Russian naturalist Nikolai Severtzov proposed the generic name Catolynx in 1858 followed by the suggestion of Chaus catolynx by Austrian zoologist Leopold Fitzinger for the "swamp lynx" in 1869. In 1898, the British zoologist William Edward de Winton proposed to subordinate the specimens from the Caucasus, Persia and Turkestan to Felis chaus typica, and regrouped the lighter built specimens from the Indian subcontinent to F. c. affinis. He renamed the Egyptian jungle cat as F. c. nilotica because Felis r√ºppelii was already applied to a different cat. A skin collected near Jericho in 1864 led him to describe a new subspecies, F. c. furax, as this skin was smaller than other Egyptian jungle cat skins. A few years later, the German zoologist Alfred Nehring also described a jungle cat skin collected in Palestine, which he named Lynx chrysomelanotis.
