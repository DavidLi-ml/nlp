Some full-time outdoor populations are given supplemental cat food by property owners, either to encourage them to stay or due to humane motivations of not wanting thin, hungry, or sick animals on the property. Other property owners deliberately do not feed outside farm cats in the mistaken belief that they will not hunt rodents if they have supplemental food. However, one concern with providing supplemental outdoor feed is that it can attract skunks, raccoons and other vermin.
