Since the 1960s, populations of the Caucasian jungle cat living along the Caspian Sea and in the Caucasus range states have been rapidly declining. Only small populations persist today. There has been no record in the Astrakhan Nature Reserve in the Volga Delta since the 1980s. Jungle cats are rare in the Middle East. In Jordan, they are highly affected by the expansion of agricultural areas around the river beds of Yarmouk and Jordan rivers, where they are hunted and poisoned by farmers for attacking poultry. They are considered rare and threatened in Afghanistan as well. India exported jungle cat skins in large numbers, till this was banned in 1979; some illegal trade, however, continues in the country, as well as in Egypt and Afghanistan.
