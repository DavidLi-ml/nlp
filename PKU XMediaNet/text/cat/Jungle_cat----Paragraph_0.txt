The jungle cat (Felis chaus), also called reed cat or swamp cat, is a medium-sized cat found in China, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and central and southeastern Asia. A member of the genus Felis, that consists of small cats, the jungle cat was first described by naturalist Johann Anton Güldenstädt in 1776; however, naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber, who gave the cat its present binomial name, is generally considered to be the binomial authority. 10 subspecies are recognised. The jungle cat is a large, long-legged cat; it stands nearly 36 centimetres (14 in) at shoulder and weighs 2–16 kilograms (4.4–35.3 lb). The coat, sandy, reddish brown or grey, is uniformly coloured and lacks spots; melanistic and albino individuals are also known. Moults occur biannually.
