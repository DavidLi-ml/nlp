Primarily a carnivore, the jungle cat prefers small mammals (gerbils, hares and rodents) and birds; fishes, frogs, insects and reptiles (small snakes) are hunted as well. Its prey typically weigh less than 1 kilogram (2.2 lb), mammals as large as young gazelles may also be hunted. The cat may be omnivorous as it may eat fruits, especially in winter. In a study done in the Sariska Tiger Reserve (Rajasthan, India), rodents were found to comprise as high as 95% of the diet.
