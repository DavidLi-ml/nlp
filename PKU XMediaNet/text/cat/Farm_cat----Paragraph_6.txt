If given supplemental food or where rodents are plentiful, losses from predation or disease may be made up by new stray animals moving into territory. If given no supplemental food, particularly in areas with high numbers of predators, farm cat populations may occasionally become extirpated if there are few nearby strays and a low breeding population. Predators, accidents, disease, parasites and hunger will all take a toll. More often, especially when supplemental food is provided, overpopulation is common, and losses then occur primarily due to disease or accidents, with predation playing a minor roleâ€”all insufficient to make a substantial dent in the population. Where numbers become an issue, some farm cat populations are controlled by shooting, poisoning, or trapping excess numbers. Sometimes, excess numbers are given to animal shelters, but if the animals are feral, their chances of adoption are low.
