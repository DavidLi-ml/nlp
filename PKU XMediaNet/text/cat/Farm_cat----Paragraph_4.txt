Farm cats originate from a variety of sources. Sometimes, property owners obtain and release a few cats specifically for rodent control. In other cases, farm cat populations are spontaneously established when abandoned or stray animals, uninvited by humans, move into areas where prey is available, such as haystacks or farm outbuildings that contain stored crops or livestock fodder.
