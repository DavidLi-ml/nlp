The jungle cat is a member of the genus Felis, which consists of small cats, within the family Felidae. Baltic German naturalist Johann Anton Güldenstädt was the first to identify a jungle cat when he travelled in the southern frontier of the Russian empire during 1768–1775 at the behest of Catherine II of Russia. He described the animal in a 1776 publication by the name "chaus". However, German zoologist Paul Matschie in 1912 and American zoologist Joel Asaph Allen in 1920 challenged the validity of nomenclature of the jungle cat, arguing that the name Felis auriculis apice nigro barbatis was improper (not being a binomen) and that "chaus" was used as a common name rather than as part of the scientific name in the publication. Mammal Species of the World identifies German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber as the binomial authority, who formally used the species name chaus in his 1777 publication Die Säugthiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur mit Beschreibungen.
