The jungle cat is largely oriental in its distribution; it is found in China, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and central and southeastern Asia. They are the commonest small cats in India. Believed to be absent from south of the Isthmus of Kra in the Malayan peninsula, the possibility of their occurrence was reported from a highly fragmented forest in the Malaysian state of Selangor in 2010.
