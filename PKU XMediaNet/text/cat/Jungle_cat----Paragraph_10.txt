The jungle cat is a large, long-legged cat; it is, in fact, the largest of the extant Felis species. The head-and-body length is typically between 59 and 76 centimetres (23 and 30 in). This cat stands nearly 36 centimetres (14 in) at shoulder and weighs 2–16 kilograms (4.4–35.3 lb). A study showed that body size showed a decrease from west (Israel) to east (India); this was attributed to greater competition from small cats in the east; body size shows a similar decrease from the northern latitudes toward the tropics. Sexually dimorphic, females tend to be smaller and lighter than males.. The face is long and narrow, with a white muzzle. The large, pointed ears, 4.5–8 centimetres (1.8–3.1 in) in length and reddish brown on the back, are set close together; a small tuft of black hairs, nearly 15 millimetres (0.59 in) long, emerges from the tip of both ears. The eyes have yellow irides and elliptical pupils; white lines can be seen around the eye. Dark lines run from the corner of the eyes down the sides of the nose and a dark patch marks the nose. The skull is fairly broad in the region of the zygomatic arch; hence the head of this cat appears relatively rounder.
