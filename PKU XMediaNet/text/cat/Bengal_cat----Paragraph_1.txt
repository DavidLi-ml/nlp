The name "Bengal cat" was derived from the taxonomic name of the Asian leopard cat (P. b. bengalensis). They have a "wild" appearance with large spots, rosettes, and a light/white belly, and a body structure reminiscent of the ALC. Once separated by at least four generations from the original ALC Ã— domestic cat crossing, the breed possesses a gentle domestic cat temperament.
