A habitat generalist, the jungle cat inhabits places with adequate water and dense vegetation, such as swamps, wetlands and riparian areas. Reeds and tall grasses being typical of its habitat, it is often known as the "reed cat" or the "swamp cat". Unlike its name, the jungle cat shuns rainforests and woodlands; it also keeps away from open areas. In Indochina, the jungle cat occurs mainly in deciduous forests rich in dipterocarp trees. Jungle cats are common in agricultural lands, such as fields of bean and sugarcane, across their range. They have often been sighted near human settlements. They can thrive even in areas of sparse vegetation. The jungle cat does not adapt well to cold climates, and is rare in areas where snowfall is common; it generally occurs up to an altitude of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft), though it may occur at as high as 2,400 metres (7,900 ft) in the Himalayas.
