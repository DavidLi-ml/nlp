The primary purpose of the ring is bullfighting, but it is usually limited to some festival weeks in the year. In other times, it may be used as a concert venue as in the Rock en el ruedo tour of Miguel RÃ­os or the live record Diamonds & Rust in the Bullring, featuring a Joan Baez concert in the Bilbao plaza.
