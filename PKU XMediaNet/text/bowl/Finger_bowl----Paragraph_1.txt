This custom starts with the delivery of the dessert plate with finger bowl and silverware, as one unit. "This is the only time during a formal meal that a guest takes part in placing the appointments for a course"; that is, they are responsible for moving the silverware and finger bowl (together with doily) off of the dessert plate. The bowl is "less than half"  or as much as "three-quarters" filled with water. Guests lightly dip fingertips into the water, one hand at a time, and then wipe them on the napkin below the table.
