A finger bowl is a bowl of water used for rinsing one's fingers between courses during formal, multiple course meals. It is typically served before the dessert course, arriving with the dessert plate and with a linen doily between plate and bowl. A glass ornament, flower, flower petals, lemon slice, sprig of mint or other decoration is often floated in it. It is especially useful when the main course involves food which cannot be eaten entirely with silverware, such as lobster, clams, or corn on the cob.
