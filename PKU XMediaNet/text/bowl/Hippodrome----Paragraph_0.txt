The hippodrome (Greek: ἱππόδρομος) was an ancient Grecian stadium for horse racing and chariot racing. The name is derived from the Greek words hippos (ἵππος; "horse") and dromos (δρόμος; "course"). The term is used in the modern French language and some others, with the meaning of "horse racecourse"; hence, some present-day horse racing tracks are also called 'hippodromes', for example the Central Moscow Hippodrome.
