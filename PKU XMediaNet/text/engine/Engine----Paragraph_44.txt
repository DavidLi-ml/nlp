In the case of engines outputting shaft power, engine speed is measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). Engines may be classified as low-speed, medium-speed or high-speed but these terms are inexact and depend on the type of engine being described. Generally, diesel engines operate at lower speed compared to gasoline engines. Electric motors and turboshafts are capable of very high speeds. In the case of engines producing thrust, it is rather inaccurate to talk of an 'engine speed' since what is moving is not the engine, but the working medium that the engine is accelerating; in this case one talks of an exhaust velocity, which is exactly the Isp outside of a gravitational field and therefore makes one jump straight to a discussion of efficiency; see the article on specific impulse for more information.
