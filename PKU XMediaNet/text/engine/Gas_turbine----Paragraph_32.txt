Mechanically, gas turbines can be considerably less complex than internal combustion piston engines. Simple turbines might have one main moving part, the compressor/shaft/turbine rotor assembly (see image above), with other moving parts in the fuel system. However, the precision manufacture required for components and the temperature resistant alloys necessary for high efficiency often make the construction of a simple gas turbine more complicated than a piston engine.
