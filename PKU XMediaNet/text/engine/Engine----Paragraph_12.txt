As for internal combustion piston engines, these were tested in France in 1807 by de Rivaz and independently, by the Ni√©pce brothers. They were theoretically advanced by Carnot in 1824. In 1853-57 Eugenio Barsanti and Felice Matteucci invented and patented an engine using the free-piston principle that was possibly the first 4-cycle engine.
