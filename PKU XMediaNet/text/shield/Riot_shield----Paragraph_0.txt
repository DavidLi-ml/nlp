Riot shields are lightweight protection devices deployed by police and some military organizations. Riot shields are almost exclusively long enough to cover an average-sized man from the top of the head to the knees. Some riot shields are designed to be bullet resistant against low-velocity handgun and shotgun ammunition; however, most are not. They are generally intended to be used in riot control, to protect the user from shrapnel, thrown projectiles, and splash from various weapons such as a Molotov cocktail. They can also be used as short-ranged melee weapons to push back rioters.
