Although the size of a shield would vary due to personal preference and role, most were thin compared to common belief, a misconception aided by the depiction of heavy shields in films. When used in fighting, shields were most effective when used to deflect glancing blows. By deflecting a sword blow to the side, rather than blocking it head on, the attacker could be rendered open to a counterattack. This technique allowed the shield to be made lighter and more easily wielded, while reducing the amount of energy and risk of injury posed to the shield-bearer.
