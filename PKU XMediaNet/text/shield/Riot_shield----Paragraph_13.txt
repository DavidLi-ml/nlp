"Body Bunker" ballistic shields are opaque with a small, clear, armored sight window and commonly have a bright light mounted on the frontal surface. Bunker shields are not normally used by riot police, but more often tactical SWAT teams, as they are bulky, heavy, and designed to be used during slow, methodical operations where there is a higher risk of the officers being shot at.
