Scutum (English pronunciation: /ˈskuːtəm/; plural scuta; Classical Latin: [ˈskuːtũː]) is the Latin word for shield, although it has in modern times come to be specifically associated with the rectangular, semi-cylindrical body shield carried by Roman legionaries. Historically, Roman shields were of varying types depending on the role of the soldier who carried it. Oval, circular and rectangular shields were used throughout Roman history.
