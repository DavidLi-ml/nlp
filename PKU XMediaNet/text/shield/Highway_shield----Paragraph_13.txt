Toronto's primary city-maintained freeways, the Gardiner Expressway and the Don Valley Parkway, both have shields. The design is a two-tone gold-on-green roundels, with the road name in white on on the green outer ring, and either the cardinal direction (for reassurance markers) or an arrow (for guidance to the freeway) in black on the gold inner disc.
