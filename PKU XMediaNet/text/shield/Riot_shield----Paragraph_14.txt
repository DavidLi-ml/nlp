In a dynamic entry situation, a team of special police (such as SWAT) try to clear a room quickly and decisively. For example, one member would smash the door open with a battering ram, then step aside as the first team member wielding the shield entered the room and protected the door. The other team members would enter behind him and take control of the room.
