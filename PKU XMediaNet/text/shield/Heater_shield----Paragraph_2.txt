The heater shield was used by almost every class of society in medieval Europe, from knights to typical soldiers. This design lent itself to being relatively inexpensive and easy to make. It was relatively lightweight compared to other similar shields at the time such as the kite shield, being easy to move around during both mounted and on-foot combat, and had a fairly high amount of surface area, making for a solid defense. However, this style of shield was not without its flaws. When using a heater shield properly, the legs are left almost entirely unprotected, although this disadvantage can be somewhat mitigated by protection of the legs using armor.
