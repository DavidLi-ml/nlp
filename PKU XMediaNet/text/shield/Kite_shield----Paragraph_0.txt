A kite shield was a distinct type of shield from the 10thâ€“13th centuries. It was either a reverse teardrop shape or later on, flat-topped. The tapering point extended down to either a distinct or rounded point. The term is a neologism, created by Victorian antiquarians due to the shape's resemblance to an early European kite.
