This image shows another type: the middle of the shield is built up at the back, with two valleys crossing in X shape, and a grab handle in a hollow at the top end of each valley, and a forearm-restrainer arch astride each valley below the crossing. The user puts one forearm along one of the valleys, grasping the handle at its top. (This allows use with either arm.) This spreads the load of a heavy impact on the shield front more effectively across the user's forearm. (For two-handed use, the other hand could grasp the unused forearm-restrainer arch.)
