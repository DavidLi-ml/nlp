A tunnelling shield is a protective structure used in the excavation of tunnels through soil that is too soft or fluid to remain stable during the time that it takes to line the tunnel with a support structure of concrete, cast iron, or steel. In effect, the shield serves as a temporary support structure for the tunnel while it is being excavated.
