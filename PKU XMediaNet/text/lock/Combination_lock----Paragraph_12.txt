Many doors use combination locks which require the user to enter a numeric sequence on a keypad to gain entry. These special locks usually require the additional use of electronic circuitry, although purely mechanical keypad locks have been available since 1936. The chief advantage of this system is that if used for the door of a large office, each employee can be told the code number without having to supply a key to each person. However, if the code number is learned by someone outside the desired group or is not changed regularly, it could allow easy access to a potential intruder (the same could be said for all combination and keyed locks, and many other security measures, however).
