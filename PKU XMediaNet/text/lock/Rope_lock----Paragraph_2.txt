Simple rope locks are designed to immobilize only balanced or slightly unbalanced loads; they will not hold significantly unbalanced line sets in place nor are they intended to be used for line set speed control. Most traditional rope locks are rated to hold a difference of 50 pounds (23 kg) or less. For this reason, proper loading technique is essential for safe operation. Misuse of the rope lock is a common source of rigging accidents, especially among students. More complex rope locks are available which will prevent unlocking if the line set is excessively unbalanced. These load-sensing locks reduce the probability of accidents, but may cause inconvenient loading situations and are more expensive than simpler locks. Rope locks are also available which are designed to hold unbalanced line-sets and act effectively as a brake.
