In competition the forelock is braided for some events, such as those in the dressage and hunt seat disciplines. Conversely, some breeds, such as the Andalusian, are usually shown with a long, full, forelock that is never braided. Other breeds may confine the forelock with rubber bands and anchor it to the bridle. The forelock may also be roached (shaved off) in some competitions, such as polo.
