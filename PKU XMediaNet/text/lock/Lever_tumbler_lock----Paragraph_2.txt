'Double acting' lever tumbler locks were invented in 1778 by Robert Barron of England. These required the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still currently used today, mostly on doors in the UK and some parts of Scandinavia, but can still be found on safes or gun cabinets. In modern times, these locks have declined in popularity because pin tumbler locks have become cheaper.
