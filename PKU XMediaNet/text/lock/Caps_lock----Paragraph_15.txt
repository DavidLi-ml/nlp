The keyboards of some early computer terminals, including the Teletype Model 33 ASR and Lear-Siegler ADM-3A, the Apple II, and early models of the IBM PC, as well as a few Apple Keyboard models, positioned the Control key on the left of the keyboard, where Caps Lock resides on most modern keyboards. This layout was preserved for later workstation systems and is often associated with Unix workstations. Keyboards from Sun Microsystems came in two layouts; "Unix" and "PC-style", with the Unix layout having the traditional placing of the Control key and other keys. The Commodore Amiga computers all had Control key to the left, next to a tiny Caps Lock key, inactivating the rarely used Caps Lock key from the Amiga Operating System was very common. The keyboards produced for One Laptop Per Child computers also have the Control key in this location. Other vendors produce keyboards for different computer systems with this placement of the Control key, such as the Happy Hacking Keyboard. Beginning with the Google Cr-48, Chromebooks have replaced Caps Lock with a dedicated "Search" key.
