Keyboards often include a small LED to indicate that Caps Lock is active, either on the key itself or in a row with Scroll lock and Num lock indicators. While on the original IBM PC keyboard this LED was controlled by the keyboard itself, it is under software control of the computer since the introduction of the IBM AT. Some new laptop and wireless desktop keyboards lack the LED, instead providing software that gives an on-screen indicator.
