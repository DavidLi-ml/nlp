A smart lock is an electromechanics lock that gets instructions to lock and unlock the door from an authorized device using a cryptographic key and wireless protocol. Smart locks have begun to be used more commonly in residential areas, and have most likely grown in popularity due to widespread use of the smartphone. Additionally, smart locks are gaining momentum in coworking spaces and offices where smart locks often enable keyless office entry.
