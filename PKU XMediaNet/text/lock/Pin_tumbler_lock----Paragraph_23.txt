Lock snapping is possible because the lock has a weakness where the retaining bolt passes through a thinner part of the lock. A recent development is to build a lock with a front section that snaps off the main body leaving enough lock that prevents access to the operating latch. Some designs feature more than one sacrificial section which stops the door being opened from the attacked side (even with the key), but the door can be opened from the other side. Most locks sold in the UK since 2010 have been designed to reduce the risk of this attack. You can reduce the threat of cylinder snapping by using cylinders designed to prevent the method of attack, cylinders that prevent this method of attack will meet TS007 3 standard. TS007 3 star cylinders will preferably be fitted in conjunction with a high security mechanism and handle set.
