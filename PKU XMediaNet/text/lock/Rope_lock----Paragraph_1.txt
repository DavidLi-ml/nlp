Two metal cams, one stationary and one movable, are used to immobilize the rope. The position of the movable cam is controlled by the locking handle. When the handle is raised, the movable cam is pressed towards the stationary cam so as to grip the rope by compressing it between the cams. Conversely, the lock is released by lowering the handle, thus retracting the movable cam away from the stationary cam and releasing the grip on the rope. The position of the stationary cam can usually be adjusted with a socket head adjustment screw. This enables the spacing between the cams to be adjusted so that, when locked, the rope lock can accommodate ropes of different diameters.
