There are two main designs for the fermentation lock, or airlock. These designs work when half filled with water. When the pressure of the gas inside the fermentation vessel exceeds the prevailing atmospheric pressure the gas will push its way through the water as individual bubbles into the outside air. A sanitizing solution or vodka is sometimes placed in the fermentation lock to prevent contamination of the beer in case the water is inadvertently drawn into the fermenter.
