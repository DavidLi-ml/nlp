Little research has been published on the purpose of the forelock. However, the thick forelock is more prevalent in breeds developed in the cold, wet climates of northern Europe and is minimal on wild horse subspecies and other equine species adapted to hot, dry climates, such as the zebra or donkey. It tends to be fine and thin on many oriental horse breeds, even if they otherwise have long manes and tails. Thus, it may play a role in temperature regulation.
