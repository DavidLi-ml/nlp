A 5 lever lock is often required for home insurance and often recommended by the police for home security. There are various grades but the current British Standard (BS3621:2007) is usually required for insurance purposes. Valerie Olifent notes that "The doors of many historic churches still carry an old wooden lock although often you find that a modern 5-lever mortice lock has been installed alongside it to meet insurance requirements." BS3621:2007 requires a bolt throw of 20 mm rather than the 14 mm of the earlier British Standard.
