Depending on the keyboard layout used, holding down the shift key while Caps Lock is already on is either ignored (because all keys are already shifted), will also shift keys which are not being shifted by Caps Lock alone (see above) or effectively invert the shifting status of each key, so that where Caps Lock shifts all keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch to lowercase again, whereas on a keyboard where Caps Lock only shifts alphabet keys, pressing Shift will temporarily switch the alpha keys to lowercase while shifting the number row as normal. Some keyboard layouts implement a fourth variant, where Shift will temporarily invoke two different sets of alternative key definitions depending on if Caps Lock is currently active or not. The inverting behaviour of the Shift key is the most common variant on English keyboards.
