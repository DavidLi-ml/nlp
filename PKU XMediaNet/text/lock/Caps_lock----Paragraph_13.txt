As described above, the Caps Lock behaviour in most QWERTY keyboard layouts differs from the Shift lock behaviour in that it capitalizes letters but does not affect other keys, such as numbers or punctuation. Some early computer keyboards, such as the Commodore 64, had a Shift lock but no Caps Lock; others, such as the BBC Micro, had both, only one of which could be enabled at a time.
