Most handsets have security measures built into their firmware that protects them from repeated attempts to guess the unlock code. After entering more than a certain number of incorrect codes the phone becomes frozen. This is a state where the phone will display a security message that the phone needs service. Older phones could not be used at all anymore at this point, but modern smartphones often keep on working with the original SIM but need extra work to then unlock them the right way. Depending on the brand this "frozen state" can sometimes be resolved both by a special unfreeze code (Samsung) and cable solution and other brands need special cable solutions. In the worst situations one would need a special so-called "JTAG" hardware solution to fix the phone. This is often needed when there is more damage to the software, often including software damage to the "bootloader".
