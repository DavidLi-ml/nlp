Die-casting became popular in the early 1930s among lock makers. Not only was it a very inexpensive way to make padlocks, but it allowed designers to design padlocks with a broad range of geometrical features and ornate designs that sand casting and machining wouldn't allow. Some lock makers, like Junkunc Brothers, augmented their machined solid body padlock products with the less expensive and more attractive die-cast bodied padlocks. The Wise Lock Company embraced this new medium in making a novel padlock that, with the key inserted, would split lengthwise along the body in order to create an opening in the shackle. Chicago Lock pioneered their new "double bitted wafer" and "ACE" products by installing them into a die cast body. With the advent of inexpensive machining done overseas and the overall poor perception of the security of die cast locks, they no longer dominate today's padlock market.
