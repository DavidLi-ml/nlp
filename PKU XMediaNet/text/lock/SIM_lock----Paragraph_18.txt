Some companies offer an online unlocking service. This service requires that individuals who wish to unlock a handset provide their IMEI number and sometimes also country and operator details to the company, either via email or a web site. The company will then provide the unlock code for the handset. For some brands such as Nokia and Samsung various services also offer special remote unlock software with instructions where a cable is needed to remove the SIM lock at home. Such companies may email the unlocking code or software which will remotely unlock the device. Some companies also offer unlocking services that require sending IMEI number. Other companies sell unlocking hardware, including devices which fit between the SIM card and the phone to spoof the original network id during registration and devices to read and edit the handset's firmware. The pricing for unlocking a device will vary depending on the network it is locked to and the model itself, as each unlock code is unique to the handset. On average it typically costs around 15 USD depending on model and make, but for newer phones the price can go as high as 50 USD (for Apple unlocking even as high as 150 USD). Some service providers offer unlocking services for their subscribers worldwide.
