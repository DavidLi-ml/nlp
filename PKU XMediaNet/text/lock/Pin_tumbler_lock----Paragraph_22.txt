Lock snapping is a method of forced entry that only affects certain types of cylinder lock, such as the euro cylinder which are commonly found on uPVC doors in Europe. Lock snapping is when a force is applied to the lock cylinder, usually with a pair of mole grips / locking pliers and ripped out from the door - allowing access to the latch mechanism. It can take between 50 seconds and 2 minutes to snap the lock and gain entry. Police in the UK have estimated that around 22 million doors throughout the country could be at risk from lock snapping.
