In a theater fly system, a rope lock is a device used to prevent a rope, and the line set it controls, from moving. A rope lock is controlled by a steel handle that engages the lock when vertical and releases it when horizontal. The handle is typically red powder coated or covered by a red rubber grip. A steel, oval-shaped safety ring encircles both the rope and the handle to ensure that the lock cannot be accidentally released. Rope locks are mounted to a locking rail, which provides structural support and holds them at a convenient level for the stage crew.
