Typing case-sensitive passwords that are not displayed verbatim on the screen may cause mistakes when Caps Lock is on. Help guides, tech support materials, and sometimes the interface itself may include advice on checking Caps Lock before typing a password. In Windows login screens, a warning that Caps Lock is on is shown in a balloon near the field. In Mac OS X, when Caps Lock is on, a Caps Lock symbol (â‡ª) is displayed inside a password field. Operating systems may also provide audible notifications when Caps Lock, Num lock, or Scroll lock buttons are toggled.
