During the early Bronze Age, urban economies developed due to urban settlements and the development of trade. The recording of trade became necessary because production, shipments, inventories, and wage payments had to be noted, and merchants needed to preserve records of their transactions. Tokens were replaced by pictographic tablets that could express not only "how many" but also "where, when, and how." More information was able to be given on these tablets and look like modern day receipts. This introduces the idea of earliest form of writing, Sumerian cuneiform, the first official writing system, in 3,100 BCE.
