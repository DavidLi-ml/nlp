French-American archaeologist, Denise Schmandt-Besserat, focused much of her career on the discovery of over 8,000 ancient tokens found in the Middle East. She visited museums all around the world studying tablets, bricks, and pots and was surprised to find clay marble spheres dating from 10,000–6,000 BCE. in every museum. There wasn’t much information on these clay marbles and archaeologists didn’t know too much about them. Schmandt-Besserat put aside her research of clay and spent the rest of her career to figuring out the use of these clay marbles.
