They collected tokens and stored them for future promised transactions, or as a record of a past transaction. The practice of storing tokens in clay envelopes was the more significant for the development of mathematics. Because the clay envelope was not transparent, therefore if you forget what is inside, the only way to find out is to break open the seal. The resolution of this problem was to impress the tokens on the outside of the envelope before sealing them inside. The outside marks could then serve as a reference and the envelope could be broken open to check the actual contents if there was any dispute about the marks.
