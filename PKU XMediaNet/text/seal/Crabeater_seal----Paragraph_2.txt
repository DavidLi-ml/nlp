Adult seals (over five years old) grow to an average length of 230 cm (7.5 ft) and an average weight of around 200 kg (440 lb). Females are on average 6 cm (2.4 in) longer and around 8 kg heavier than males, though their weights fluctuate substantially according to season; females can lose up to 50% of their body weight during lactation, and males lose a significant proportion of weight as they attend to their mating partners and fight off rivals. Large crabeater seals can weigh up to 300 kg (660 lb). Pups are about 120 cm in length and 20 and 30 kg at birth. While nursing, pups grow at a rate of about 4.2 kg a day, and can weigh as much as 100 kg by the time they are weaned after only two to three weeks.
