The generic name Cystophora means "bladder-bearer" in Greek, from the species' unusual sexual ornament â€“ a peculiar inflatable bladder on the head of the adult male. This bladder hangs between the eyes and down over the upper lip in the deflated state. In addition, the hooded seal can inflate a large balloon-like sac from one of its nostrils. This is done by shutting one nostril valve and inflating a membrane, which then protrudes from the other nostril.
