Transactions for trading needed to be accounted for efficiently, so the clay tokens were placed in a clay ball (bulla) to keep the tokens together. This helped with dishonesty and kept all the tokens together. In order to account for the tokens, the bulla would have to be crushed to reveal their content. This introduced the idea of impressing the token onto the wet bulla before it dried,to insure trust that the tokens hadn't been tampered with and for anyone to know what exactly was in the bulla without having to break it. Eventually seals were impressed into the clay alongside of the impression of the tokens. Each party had its own unique seal to identify them. Seals would not only identify individuals, but it would also identify their office.
