Guadalupe fur seals are sexually dimorphic in size, with the males being much larger than females, although few specimens have been measured. Individuals of both sexes are dark brown or dusky black, with the guard hairs on the back of the neck being yellowish or light tan. Pups are born with a black coat similar to that of adults. Observations suggest reproductive males are faithful to particular sites over a number of years. Tenure of territorial males lasts from 35â€“122 days. Births occur from mid-June through July, with most births taking place in June. The seals are one of the few with visible earflaps, confirming it is not a Phocidaen/true seal.
