Simple tokens were impressed to make marks on a solid lump, or tablet, of clay. Only the tablet was then kept. Because the complicated shapes and designs of the complex tokens, they did not transfer well to the tablet, an image of the token was drawn on the clay. This practice, in place by about 3,000 BCE, afforded greater ease of use and storage, at a price of a certain loss of security. These impressed or drawn marks on the clay tablets were the beginnings of a numeration system.
