The World Yo-Yo Contest was originally held each year in Orlando, Florida and was hosted by YoYoGuy.com during early August or late July. However, in 2014 the World Yo-Yo Contest was held in Prague, Czech Republic for the first time taking the contest outside of North America. The 2015 Contest will take place in Tokyo, Japan. The World Yo-Yo Contest takes the winners from national yo-yo contests around the world and pits them against each other. Japanese players in particular have risen to the top of the yo-yo world. The eleven-time, double-handed world champion Shinji Saito—considered the best in the world in the double-handed looping (2A) division—is Japanese. Countries such as the United States, Brazil, Japan and the UK hold competitions at the national and regional levels. In addition, national yo-yo contests, without regionals, are held every year by Mexico, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, France, Germany, Switzerland, The Czech Republic, Hungary, and Australia.
