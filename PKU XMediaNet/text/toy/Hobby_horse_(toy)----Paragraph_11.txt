Hobby Horse Polo uses parts of the polo rules but has its own specialities, as e.g. 'punitive sherries' and is using hobby horses instead of ponies. The Hobby Horse variant started 1998 as a fun sport in south western Germany and lead 2002 to the foundation of the First Kurfürstlich-Kurpfälzisch Polo-Club in Mannheim. In the meantime it gained further interest in other German cities.
