Germany produced the most prized dollhouses and doll house miniatures up until World War I. Notable German miniature companies included MÃ¤rklin, Rock and Graner and others. Their products were not only avidly collected in Central Europe, but regularly exported to Britain and North America. Germany's involvement in WWI seriously impeded both production and export. New manufacturers in other countries arose.
