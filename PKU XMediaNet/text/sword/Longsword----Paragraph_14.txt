Type XVIa is the classical "longsword" of the 14th and 15th centuries. These blades are long and slowly tapering, with a flat hexagonal blade cross-section and a fuller running along one third of the lade. They represent an optimised compromise between thrusting capability and retaining good cutting characteristics.
