The swords manufactured in Indian workshops, such as the Khanda, find mention in the writing of Muhammad al-Idrisi. In Sri Lanka, a unique wind furnace was used to produce the high quality steel. This gave the blade a very hard cutting edge and beautiful patterns. For these reasons it became a very popular trading material.
