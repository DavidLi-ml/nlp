The high medieval sword of the Romanesque period (10th to 13th centuries) develops gradually from the Carolingian sword (spatha) of the 9th century. In the Late Medieval period (14th and 15th centuries), use of derived or late forms of these swords continued to be used, but now often as a sidearm, especially of the estoc type, now called "arming sword" and contrasting with the two-handed, heavier longsword. After the end of the medieval period, the arming sword develops into the early modern rapier.
