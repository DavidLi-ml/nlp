 Type X is the Norman sword as it developed out of the early medieval Viking sword by the 11th century.  Type XI shows the development towards a more tapering point seen during the 12th century.  Type XII is a further development, typical throughout the Crusades period, showing a tapering blade with a shortened fuller. Subtype XIIa comprises the longer and more massive "great-swords" which developed in the mid-13th century, probably designed to counter improvements in mail armour; these are the predecessors of the late medieval longsword (see also Cawood sword).
