The Lightsaber is the signature weapon of Jedi and Sith in the Star Wars universe. Its blade is a beam of concentrated energy. Typically consisting of a single hilt and blade, there are a few variant forms of lightsaber, such as the double-bladed Lightsaber, or Saberstaff, wielded by Darth Maul, and the short-bladed Shoto.
