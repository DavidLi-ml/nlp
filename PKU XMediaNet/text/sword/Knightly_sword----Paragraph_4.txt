The term "romanesque sword" does not see significant use in English, but it is more current in French (epée romane), German (romanisches Schwert) and especially in and Slavic (Czech románský meč etc.), identifying the swords by their being contemporary with the corresponding Romanesque period in art history (roughly 1000 to 1300).
