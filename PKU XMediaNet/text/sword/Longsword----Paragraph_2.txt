Historical (15th to 16th century) terms for this type of sword included Spanish espadón, montante, or mandoble, Italian spadone or spada longa (lunga), Portuguese montante and Middle French passot. The Gaelic claidheamh mòr means "great sword"; anglicised as claymore, it came to refer to the Scottish type of longsword with v-shaped crossguard. Historical terminology overlaps with that applied to the Zweihänder sword in the 16th century: French espadon, Spanish espadón, or Portuguese montante may also be used more narrowly to refer to these large swords. The French épée de passot may also refer to a medieval single-handed sword optimized for thrusting.
