The Arming sword (or Knightly sword in modern terminology) was the most widespread type of sword in the European High Middle Ages. It was a straight, double-edged weapon with a single-handed cruciform hilt and a blade length of about 70 to 80 centimetres (28 to 31 in). The type is frequently depicted in period artwork, and numerous examples have been preserved archaeologically.
