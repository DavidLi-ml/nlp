It is generally possible to make a collect call from a landline by dialing "0" and following automated prompts or using operator assistance. The receiving party must agree to the charges (usually after being informed of the name of the caller) before the call can continue normally. In general, customers can configure their landline or cell phone account to block attempted collect calls. Because the name of the caller is given before charges are accepted, it is possible to communicate a simple message for free by giving an agreed-upon name or simply using the call to synchronize an action (e.g. indicating it is time to meet). This is, however, considered toll fraud and can be prosecuted, although in most cases it is probably unlikely the person could be caught.
