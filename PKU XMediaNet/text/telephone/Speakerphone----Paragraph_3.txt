Full-duplex speakerphones are able to transmit and receive simultaneously and there is no discernible change of transmission direction. These phones are much more complicated and often employ sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to sort out the incoming sound and the sound in the room for echo cancellation. Their cost is also higher than for a half-duplex speakerphone.
