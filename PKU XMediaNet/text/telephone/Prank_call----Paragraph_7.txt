Some prank calls are criminalized in many jurisdictions, while others may be protected as freedom of expression. For example, in the US, for a prank call to fall afoul of the Telecommunications Act, 47 U.S.C. ยง 223(a)(1), the call must be done with the intent to "annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass". In Australia, the 2Day FM incident is alleged by ACMA to have violated Australian law, but on the grounds that the recorded call was publicly broadcast without the other party's consent.
