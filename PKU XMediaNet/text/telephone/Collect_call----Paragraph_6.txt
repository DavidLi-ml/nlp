Telstra ran a reverse charge service called HomeLink during the 1990s and 2000s. Homelink consisted of a 1800 number and pin that could only be linked to the user's home phone service. Calls were billed at a slightly higher cost than a standard local call. HomeLink grew out of popularity with the rise in mobile phones.
