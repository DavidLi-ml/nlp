The Cartoon Network series Regular Show featured an episode centered around prank calls in its first season, entitled "Prank Callers". Inspired by watching online videos of the "world's best prank caller", the show's protagonists, Mordecai and Rigby, attempt to make several prank calls of their own. After the two fail to prank the world's best prank caller, they are sent back in time to 1982, and are later joined by the rest of the show's main cast. The episode then focuses on the group's efforts to return to their proper time period.
