A cordless telephone uses a radio transceiver as its handset, and a radio transceiver, wired to the telephone line, as a base station. In a mobile telephone, the entire unit is usually a radio transceiver that communicates through an outdoor base station located at a cell site. Some mobile telephones that can be carried in cars, trucks, and buses look exactly like household telephones, except that their bases are usually screwed or bolted to the interior of the vehicle.
