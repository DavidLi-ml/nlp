In the UK, a number of services offer reverse charge calling. A caller can dial the operator on 100 and ask for a reverse charge call, or alternatively dial an automated service such as 0800 Reverse or 08000MUMDAD. Reverse charge calls can be made for free on some mobile networks, although the person being contacted via this service may be charged a considerable amount for accepting such a call.
