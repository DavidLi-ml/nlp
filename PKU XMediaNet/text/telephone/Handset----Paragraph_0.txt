On a wired telephone, the handset is a device that a user holds to the ear to hear the audio sound through the receiver. Since the 1920s, handsets usually also contain the phone's transmitter (microphone) which is positioned close to the mouth. In earlier telephones the transmitter was mounted directly on the telephone itself, which often was attached to a wall at a convenient height.
