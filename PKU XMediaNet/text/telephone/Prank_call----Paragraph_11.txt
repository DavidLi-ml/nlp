Until his death in 2011, Oklahoma construction worker Frank Garrett was prank called and recorded countless times for his vitriol reactions. The soundboard community that followed him caused at least two known incidents with the law, one in Kansas City and the other in Houston; both were for threats of violence against the police using his voice. Both incidents were covered by local FOX News stations.
