On an episode of Pee-Wee's Playhouse, the mischievous Randy makes a prank call (the classic "Is your refrigerator running? Then you better catch it!" gag) and talks Pee-Wee into doing so also. The recipient of the call is irritated and gets her husband on the phone, a police officer. The officer warns Pee-Wee that making prank calls is against the law and that it can result in going to jail and a lifetime criminal record.
