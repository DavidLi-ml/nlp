Formula 1000 is an open wheel class of Formula car racing by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) where a 1000 cc motorcycle engine is used to power a single seat, open wheel race car with full racing aerodynamics and suspension. The F1000 class, also called FB, was created by SCCA in 2006. Similar SCCA classes include FA (Formula Atlantic), FC (Formula Continental), FF (Formula Ford) and FV (Formula Vee). Motorcycle power formula cars have been popular in the UK for many years and have been a very successful class.
