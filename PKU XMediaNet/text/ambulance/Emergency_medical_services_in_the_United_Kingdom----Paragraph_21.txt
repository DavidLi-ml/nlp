Private ambulance services are common the UK, with over 200 providers, and their use under contract to the NHS to answer 999 calls has been growing year on year, with every NHS ambulance trust using private providers in each year from 2011−2014, and contracted providers answering three quarters of a million 999 calls in that three-year period. Expenditure on private ambulances in England increased from £37m in 2011−12 to £67.5m in 2013/4, rising in London from £796,000 to more than £8.8m. In 2014−15, these 10 ambulance services spent £57.6 million on 333,329 callouts of private or voluntary services - an increase of 156% since 2010−11. This use of private contractors for frontline services has been politically controversial, although 56% of the British public believe that greater private sector involvement will help maintain or improve standards in the NHS.
