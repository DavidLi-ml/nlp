The trust was formed on 1 July 2006 following the three-way merger of the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Ambulance and Paramedic Service NHS Trust, the East Anglian Ambulance NHS Trust, and the Essex Ambulance Service NHS Trust. The result was a service covering an area of over 7,500 square miles (19,000 km2) with a population of 5.8 million people, and one which answers over 500,000 emergency calls per year.
