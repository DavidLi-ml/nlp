Across Great Britain, there is a network of volunteer Blood Bikes groups who provide motorcycle courier services for blood, tissue and organs which require transport to, or between, hospitals. In most cases, they carry blue lights and sirens which can be used when transporting blood or human tissue for transplant. There is a national organisation representing these groups, called the Nationwide Association of Blood Bikes (NABB).
