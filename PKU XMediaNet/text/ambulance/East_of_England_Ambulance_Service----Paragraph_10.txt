In 2013-14 the Trust missed all of its targets in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. 73.6% of “red 1 calls” for immediately life-threatening situations were met within eight minutes against a target of 75%. 69.4% of “red 2 calls”, which may be life-threatening but less time critical were responded to within eight minutes against a 75% target. In north Norfolk, rapid responses during one month were as low as 25%. According to the Clinical Commissioning Group performance had “deteriorated overall in comparison to prior year at both regional and local level”. In August 2014, the Trust was fined £1.2m over these failures. It was also fined £300,000 over turnaround times at hospitals. The fines were accrued between April and July 2014. EEAST, which handles more than 900,000 emergency 999 calls a year, said it was recruiting hundreds of new staff and investing in new ambulances. In a statement in November 2014, Chief executive Anthony Marsh blamed EEASTS’ continued failure to meet its emergency response time targets on a lack of staff. Acknowledging that the service was still "not good enough” he said that "significant progress" had been made; 536 student paramedics and a further 69 graduate and qualified paramedics and emergency medical technicians had been recruited since January 2014.
