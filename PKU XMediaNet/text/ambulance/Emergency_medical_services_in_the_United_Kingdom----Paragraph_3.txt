In addition to ambulance services provided by NHS organisations, there are also some private and volunteer emergency medical services arrangements in place in the UK, including all air ambulances (except those operated by the Scottish Ambulance Service), the use of private or volunteer ambulances at public events or large private sites, and as part of community provision of services such as community first responders.
