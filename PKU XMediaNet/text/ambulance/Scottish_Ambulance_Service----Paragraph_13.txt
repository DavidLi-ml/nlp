In 2010 the service established three teams of specialist accident & emergency ambulance personnel who were given specialist training. This Â£4.3 million initiative was to provide additional preparedness to be able to respond to large-scale hazardous incidents, such as those that might involve chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear material. The work was in concert with the UK government.
