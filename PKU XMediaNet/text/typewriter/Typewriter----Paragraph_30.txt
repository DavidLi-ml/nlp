In English-speaking countries, the commonplace typewriters printing fixed-width characters were standardized to print six horizontal lines per vertical inch, and had either of two variants of character width, called "pica" for ten characters per horizontal inch and "elite" for twelve. This differed from the use of these terms in printing, where they refer to the height of the characters on the page ("pica" designating ten horizontal lines per vertical inch).
