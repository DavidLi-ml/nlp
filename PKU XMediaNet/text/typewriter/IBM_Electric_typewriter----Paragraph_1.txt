IBM typewriters had one feature lacking in many mechanical typewriters: the top row bore the digits 1234567890; other typewriters generally omitted the 1 and 0. The IBM design obviated substitutions taught by many typing instructors: o or O for 0; l for 1. These substitutions were easily identified when compared to an adjacent line typed with the digit keys and encouraged typists to confuse letters and numbers, even in speech.
