Many older typewriters did not include a separate key for the numeral 1 or the exclamation point, and some even older ones also lacked the numeral zero. Typists who trained on these machines learned the habit of using the lowercase letter l ("ell") for the digit 1, and the uppercase O for the zero. A cents symbol (Â¢) was created by combining (over-striking) a lower case 'c' with a slash character (typing 'c', then backspace, then '/').
