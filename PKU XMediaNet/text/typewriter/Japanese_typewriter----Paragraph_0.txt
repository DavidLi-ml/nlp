The first practical Japanese typewriter (Japanese: 和文タイプライター) was invented by Kyota Sugimoto in 1929. Out of the thousands of kanji characters, Kyota's original typewriter used 2,400 of them. He obtained the patent rights to the typewriter that he invented in 1915. Until the popularization of word processor technology, the Japanese typewriter contributed greatly to increased efficiency of document preparation at Japanese companies and government offices.
