The first Olympia typewriter was invented in 1903, but the first successful Olympia model, the Model 3, was released in 1923. Olympia typewriters were most successful in Germany, the country of invention, but between 1950 and 1970, manufacturing facilities were opening in Canada, Ireland, Mexico, and Chile. The Olympia portable typewriters were the most popular out of all the different models that Olympia produced. Olympia typewriters were known for their "craftsmanship, eye-catching design, and continuous innovation." Some of the Olympia typewriterâ€™s novel features were individually spring-loaded keys, which provided extra comfort and cushioning; different colors like caramel, mint aquamarine, and pink; and script-typing options. There was even a one-handed version of an Olympia typewriter, the Model 8, for disabled users.
