GTA: San Andreas: The player can discover a "Glendale" (a Chrysler New Yorker) in the backwoods on occasion. Sometimes the vehicle will begin driving itself, with no NPC visible inside the vehicle. This has spawned many rumors in the GTA community. However, the true reason for the "ghost car's" existence is so that the player could work their way out of the woods if they totaled their previous vehicle. The reason that it sometimes begins to move is that the car will occasionally spawn on a hill, with the parking brake disengaged, letting the car roll forward.
