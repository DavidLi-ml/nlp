Until the middle 1990s, the vehicles of the Lisbon Municipal Police were painted with the same pattern of the Los Angeles Police Department. The black and white livery of the vehicles reflected the colors of the Flag of the City of Lisbon. Since the middle 1990s, the vehicles of this police force are entirely white, with a stripe along the sides checkered with the black and white gyronny field of the Flag of Lisbon.
