The New York State Police use a 2001 Toyota Sequoia as an unmarked vehicle and a few Toyota Siennas, Ford F350s, Honda Odysseys, and the recent model Toyota Tundra. At one point, they had Mustangs. The State Police also possess a fourth-generation Chevrolet Camaro for use as a high-speed intercept vehicle on Interstate 90.
