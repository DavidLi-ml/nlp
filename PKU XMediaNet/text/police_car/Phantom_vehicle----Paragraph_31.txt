"You Drive", an episode of The Twilight Zone that aired originally on January 3, 1964, features a 1956 Ford Fairlane whose driver is involved in a hit-and-run accident that injures a young boy. The boy later dies. The car engages in a series of "malfunctions", including blasting its own horn, blinking its headlights, and turning on its radio, that escalate until it starts itself up and follows its owner as he walks to work one day. The passenger side door opens, at which point the man gets in and the car drives him to the police station to confess.
