To show the police what is new, a marked police car with the manufacturer's name (Ford, General Motors, Chrysler) can be displayed with the words "Not In Service" to show what is new with that model of car and get feedback from police departments. Companies like Whelen, Federal Signal and Code 3 also have demo cars with their names on the side and showing the police what is new in the field of emergency vehicle equipment.
