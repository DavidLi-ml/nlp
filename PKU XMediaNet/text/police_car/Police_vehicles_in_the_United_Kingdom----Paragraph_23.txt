Nearly a half of British police forces use the battenburg livery of yellow and blue checks for their vehicles. Other forces use of white, black, or silver. Silver became popular in some forces because of the higher resale values when sold. Most cars use retroreflective livery on the sides and red and yellow chevrons on the rear. Some carry slogans, the force crest and contact information.
