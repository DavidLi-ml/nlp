These vehicles are used for attending 999 calls and patrolling in targeted areas, where a police officer may be needed more urgently. Many forces do not differ between patrol and response cars; this could mean the response car is used to cover both its normal role and the duty of a traditional patrol car. Forces including City of London Police, Metropolitan Police and Thames Valley Police do not differentiate between the two types of cars and use only one specification identified as a response car. Response cars, are not authorized to pursue a failing to stop suspect, an area car, traffic car or advanced blue light trained officer, will take over the pursuit.
