Combi's: this name is given by Belgians to Police minivans like the much loved Volkswagen Transporter. Belgium has a rich tradition of using "combi's" in great number throughout the police forces (it gained most of its fame and reputation by the Belgian Rijkswacht). They're used for patrol, rapid interventions, basic police tasks, transport of personnel and material and control actions (alcohol control, etc.) (Ford Transit, VW T5)
