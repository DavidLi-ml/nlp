Bettis Custom Cymbals is a one-man "artisan"  shop run by full-time independent cymbalsmith Matt Bettis. Established in 2006, Bettis Cymbals provides high-end, custom cymbals, handmade using raw cast B20 cymbal blanks supplied by members of the Zildjian family. Beginning in June 2014, the Nomad project began with Matt Bettis travelling across The United States making cymbals on the road in his mobile cymbal shop. Each Bettis Nomad cymbal is marked with a serial number and the location in which it was made.
