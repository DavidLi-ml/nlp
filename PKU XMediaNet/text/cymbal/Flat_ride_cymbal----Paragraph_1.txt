A flat ride cymbal produces the tightest, driest, most controlled stick sound of all ride cymbals, but with an airy wash. The lack of bell makes this cymbal quieter  and most suitable for jazz. Roy Haynes was one of the first drummers to use a flat ride which can be heard on Chick Corea's album Now He Sings, Now He Sobs made in 1968.
