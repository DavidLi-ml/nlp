In an orchestral or wind band context, the cymbals are typically held parallel a few inches apart at chest height. For best crashes, the cymbals are held just off vertical, at a slight angle. For piano crashes the cymbals are brought together from centimetres apart and allowed to 'fizz' for a millisecond. Whereas for forte crashes, using both arms in an upward sweeping motion (as if you were rolling your arms and shoulders back and round to the front in circles), the cymbals are brought together with equal force from both left and right hand. Ideally, the player would allow the edge furthest away from their body to make contact first, with the rest following milliseconds later. They are rarely held almost horizontal, with the left cymbal on bottom. This is widely recognised as terrible technique, and does not bring out anything from the cymbals other than a very weak 'crash' with no depth of sound or timbre.
