The professional-grade Super Zyn range followed in 1951, realised in B20 alloy. According to Cymbals Today (a contemporary promotional material published by Premier), these instruments were endorsed by a number of professional jazz drummers, such as Ray Ellington and Eric Delaney. Sizes available were 12 inches through 24 inches and in thin, medium-thin, medium or heavy weights. Pairs of heavy cymbals were available in 14, 15 and 16 inch sizes for concert orchestra.
