One of the earliest uses of crotales in the orchestral repertoire is Claude Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune. Other classical pieces featuring Crotales include Berlioz's Symphonie Roméo et Juliette, and Ravel's, Alborada del gracioso. In Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, the score calls for two crotales in A-flat and B-flat, and his Les noces ends on a plaintive series of chords struck by a combination of chimes and crotales.
