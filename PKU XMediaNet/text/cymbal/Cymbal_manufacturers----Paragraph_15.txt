To date, the most recent reintroduction by Premier was in 2006; the new Zyn was machine-hammered B20 alloy, while the new Super Zyn was combination hand- and machine-hammered B20 alloy. Both were made in China. As with past Zyns, paired cymbals were available for concert orchestra and marching bands. The revival was brief and the cymbals are no longer produced.
