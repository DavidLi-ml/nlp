Production of all Zyn types concluded in 1984, replaced by Premier's expanding distribution of Zildjian cymbals. However, the name has since been revived on two occasions, with a German-made Zyn (subtilted 'Made in Germany') appearing in the late 1990s. Unlike previous Zyn cymbals, the logo was now stencilled onto the cymbal, as opposed to being stamped into it. The range consisted of 14 inch hi-hats, 16 and 18 inch 'Crash' cymbals, plus a 20-inch 'Medium Ride'.
