The robin is considered a symbol of spring. A well-known example is a poem by Emily Dickinson, "I Dreaded That First Robin So". Among other 19th-century poems about the first robin of spring is "The First Robin" by Dr. William H. Drummond, which according to the author's wife is based on a Quebec superstition that whoever sees the first robin of spring will have good luck. The harbinger of spring sobriquet is borne out by the fact that robins tend to follow the 37 °F (3 °C) isotherm north in spring, but also south in fall.
