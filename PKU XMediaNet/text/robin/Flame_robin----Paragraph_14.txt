When perched or between bouts of foraging on the ground, the flame robin holds itself in a relatively upright pose, with its body angled at 45Â° or less from the vertical, and its wings held low below its tail. It impresses as nervous and twitchy, flicking its wings alternately when still. The flame robin's flight is fast, with a markedly undulating character.
