The male's  song  is loud, with a range of whistles, trills and clicks and includes a flute-like "pioo" with a pure bell-like tone. it is sometimes interrupted by a rasping "dserr" sound and is rather solemn as compared to that of the nightingale. The song does not have that bird's loud whistling crescendo and is quite distinctive. It is also sometimes sung in the bird's winter quarters. The call-note "whit" resembles that of the nightingale but is higher pitched and more abrupt.
