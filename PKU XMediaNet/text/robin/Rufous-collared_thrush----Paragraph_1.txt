It is endemic to highlands of Middle America, south of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, occurring in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Chiapas state in Mexico. Its closest relative is the American robin, and like that species, it is found in varied habitats, from towns to forest. It is, however, restricted to highland areas with at least some trees. It is also known as the rufous-collared robin.
