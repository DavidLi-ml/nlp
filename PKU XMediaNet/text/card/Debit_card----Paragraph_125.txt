U.S. Federal law caps the liability of a U.S. debit card user in case of loss or theft is up to $50 USD if the loss or theft is reported to the issuing bank in two business days after the customer notices the loss. Most banks will, however, set this limit to $0 for debit cards issued to their customers which are linked to their checking or savings account. Bank of America, for example, ran advertisements as far back as 2009, promising customers using its debit card zero liability for fraud, and restoration of the amount taken in one day, subject to certain requirements.
