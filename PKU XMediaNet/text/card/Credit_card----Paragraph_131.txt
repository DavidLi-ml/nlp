Travelers from the U.S. had encountered problems abroad because many countries have introduced smart cards, but the U.S. had not. As of 2010, the U.S. banking system had not updated the cards and associated readers in the U.S., stating that the costs were prohibitive. As of 2015, the smart cards are now introduced and used in the United States.
