String pipes are the smallest-scaled flue pipes. They produce a bright sound that is low in fundamentals and rich in upper partials. String stops are generally named after bowed string instruments such as the Violoncelle, the Gamba, the Geigen (from the German geige, for violin), and the Viol. One of the most famous organs with a String Division is the Wanamaker Organ.
