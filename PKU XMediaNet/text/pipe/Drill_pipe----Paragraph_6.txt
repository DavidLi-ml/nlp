Tubes and tool joints are welded using inertia or friction welding. The tube is held stationary while the tool joint is revolved at high RPMs. The tool joint is the firmly pressed onto the upset end of the tube while the tool joint is rotating. The heat and force during this interaction weld the two together. Once the "ram horns" or excess material is removed, the weld line can only be seen under a microscope.
