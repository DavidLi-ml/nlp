In some historical sources written by colonists, a ceremonial pipe is referred to as a calumet (kal-yə-ˌmet, -mət). While sometimes mistakenly applied to all ceremonial pipes, the calumets were a specific type of pipe - often ornately carved and decorated, and used in the Catholic conversion rituals first in Illinois and then in Mi'kmaq territory. Later they were also used as trade goods and gifts. Calumet is a Norman word (pronounced: [kalyme]), first recorded in David Ferrand's La Muse normande around 1625–1655, and used by Norman-French settlers in Canada to describe the ceremonial pipes they saw used among the First Nations people of the region. Its first meaning was "sort of reeds used to make pipes", with a suffix substitution for calumel, It corresponds to the French word chalumeau, meaning 'reed' (Modern French also means 'straw', 'blowlamp'). The name of the Calumet Region in Illinois and Indiana may derive from the French term or may have an independent derivation from Potawatomi. Likewise, there is a current Umatilla term, čalámat.
