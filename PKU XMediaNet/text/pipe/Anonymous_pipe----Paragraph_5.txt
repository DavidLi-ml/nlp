On Microsoft Windows, reads and writes to anonymous pipes are always blocking. In other words, a read from an empty pipe will cause the calling thread to wait until at least one byte becomes available or an end-of-file is received as a result of the write handle of the pipe being closed. Likewise, a write to a full pipe will cause the calling thread to wait until space becomes available to store the data being written. Reads may return with fewer than the number of bytes requested (also called a short read).
