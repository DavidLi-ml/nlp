Pasteur pipettes are plastic or glass pipettes used to transfer small amounts of liquids, but are not graduated or calibrated for any particular volume. The bulb is separate from the pipette body. Pasteur pipettes are also called teat pipettes, droppers, eye droppers and chemical droppers. The proper handling of the pipettes is by holding the rubber bulb between the thumb and index finger and controlling the glass by holding it between the ring finger and the pinky. The middle finger is not used.
