A Meerschaum pipe is a smoking pipe made from the mineral sepiolite. Meerschaum (/ˈmɪərʃɔːm/ MEER-shawm or /ˈmɪərʃəm/ MEER-shəm, German for foam of the sea) is sometimes found floating on the Black Sea and rather suggestive of sea-foam, hence the German origin of the name as well as the French name for the same substance, écume de mer. The German Pipe builder Kummer was the first to make this pipe popular. The Kummer pfeife became really popular with French artists and Painters. As they pronounced the word Kummer as cum mer, it became écume de mer which was later translated to German as Meerschaum.
