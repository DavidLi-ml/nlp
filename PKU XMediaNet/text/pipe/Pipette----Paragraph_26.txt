Over rotated arm pipetting Technique: Over-rotated forearm and wrist. Rotation of the forearm in a supinated position (palm up) and/or wrist flexion increases the fluid pressure in the carpal tunnel. This increased pressure can result in compression of soft tissues like nerves, tendons and blood vessels, causing numbness in the thumb and fingers. Corrective action: Forearm rotation angle near 45Â° pronation (palm down) should be maintained to minimize carpal tunnel pressure during repetitive activity.
