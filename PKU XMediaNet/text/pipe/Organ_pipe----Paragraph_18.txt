The diaphone is a unique and uncommon organ pipe. Invented by Robert Hope-Jones around 1900, it has characteristics of both flue pipes and reed pipes. The pipe speaks through a resonator, much like a reed pipe, but a spring-loaded pallet instigates the vibration instead of a reed. Possessing a powerful bass groundtone, the pipe is generally made of wood and can be voiced at various wind pressures. The diaphone is usually found at 16′ and 32′ pitches, however there are a few examples of 8′ diaphones. There are two 32' Diaphones in Philadelphia's Wanamaker Organ, and a full-length 64′ Diaphone-Dulzian is installed in the Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ in Atlantic City.
