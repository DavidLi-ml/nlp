The use of briar wood beginning in the early 1820s greatly reduced demand for clay pipes and to a lesser degree Meerschaum pipes. The qualities of the Meerschaum were combined with those of the briar wood pipes by lining a briar pipe with a Meerschaum bowl. Some believe the Meerschaum lined briar pipe gives the porosity and sweet smoking qualities of meerschaum along with the heat-absorbing qualities and durability of briar.
