The nomenclature of a rank of open pipes (for example an "8 foot" (8 feet (2.4 m)) Open diapason) refers to the length of the longest pipe in the rank. Thus the longest pipe, (C, two octaves below middle C) is 8 feet (2.4 m) long. An 8 ft (2.4 m) stop sounds at unison pitch, like a piano. In a rank of stopped pipes, the lowest pipe is 4 feet (1.2 m) in length but sounds at unison pitch, so it is known as an 8' stop.
