The first gunpowder-powered rockets were developed in Song China, by the 13th century. The Chinese rocket technology was adopted by the Mongols and the invention was spread via the Mongol invasions to the Near East and Europe in the mid 13th century. Medieval and early modern rockets were used militarily as incendiary weapons in sieges.
