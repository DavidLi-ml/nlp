The medium and light rockets could be case shot, shell, or explosive. The 32-pounder was generally used for longer range bombardment, while a 12â€“pounder case shot was generally used for support of infantry and cavalry, with an extreme range of some 2,000 yards. The rockets could be fired from a wheeled bombarding frame, from a portable tripod, or even from a shallow trench or sloping bank. One in three horse artillerymen carried a launching trough for ground firing.
