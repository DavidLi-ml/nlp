In March 2014 a prototype named VEx-1A failed during launch from Pipinas, Punta Indio Partido, It had only one stage, 2.8 tonnes, 4t engine, 60 seconds mission, expected apogee of 2 km. VEx-1A first launch attempt was postponed in December 2013 due to ground support equipment fail. The second attempt failed on February 26, 2014. It was discovered that the failure was caused by interferences between the launch pad and the rocket, which prevented the vehicle from elevating more than 2m off the ground. The engine control mechanism shut off the fuel valve, preventing an explosion, and the rocket fell down next to the pad.
