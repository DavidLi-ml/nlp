The product was featured in the pilot of the American situation comedy 30 Rock, in which the character Jack Donaghy describes the product, claiming to have invented it himself and pegging it as his "greatest triumph" after years and years of market research. Donaghy's description of the product was taken near verbatim from GEâ€™s website. He later uses the oven as a metaphor for The Girlie Show, saying that Tracy Jordan is the "third heat".
