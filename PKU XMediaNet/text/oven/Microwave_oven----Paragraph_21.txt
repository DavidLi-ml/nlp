For cooking or reheating small amounts of food, the microwave oven may use less energy than a cook stove. Although microwave ovens are touted as the most efficient appliance, the energy savings are largely due to the reduced heat mass of the food's container. The amount of energy used to heat food is generally small compared to total energy usage in typical residences in the United States.
