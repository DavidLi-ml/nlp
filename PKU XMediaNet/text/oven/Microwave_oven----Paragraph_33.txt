Food and cookware taken out of a microwave oven are rarely much hotter than 100 째C (212 째F). Cookware used in a microwave oven is often much cooler than the food because the cookware is transparent to microwaves; the microwaves heat the food directly and the cookware is indirectly heated by the food. Food and cookware from a conventional oven, on the other hand, are the same temperature as the rest of the oven; a typical cooking temperature is 180 째C (356 째F). That means that conventional stoves and ovens can cause more serious burns.
