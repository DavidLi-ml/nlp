Comparative cooking method studies generally find that, if properly used, microwave cooking does not affect the nutrient content of foods to a larger extent than conventional heating, and that there is a tendency towards greater retention of many micronutrients with microwaving, probably due to the reduced preparation time. Microwaving human milk at high temperatures is contraindicated, due to a marked decrease in activity of anti-infective factors.
