The Trivection oven’s inclusion in 30 Rock was widely seen as an example of product placement, especially as the product was later advertised during the commercial break. However, Tina Fey, the show’s creator and writer of the episode, stated the oven was actually included in the show purely as a joke and that GE had nothing to do with it, although she suspects that "maybe somebody's taking credit for it." Allison Eckelkamp, a spokesperson for GE, confirmed this and says that GE chose to run ads for the oven during the commercial break to make sure viewers knew it was a real product, rather than one invented by the screenwriters for the purposes of the joke. At the time of broadcast, General Electric was the parent company for NBC, which produced and broadcast 30 Rock.
