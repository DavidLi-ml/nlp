An anti-ballistic missile is a missile which can be deployed to counter an incoming nuclear or non-nuclear ICBM. ICBMs can be intercepted in three regions of their trajectory: boost phase, mid-course phase or terminal phase. Currently the US, Russia, France, India, and Israel have developed anti-ballistic missile systems, of which the Russian A-135 anti-ballistic missile system, US Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, and Indian Prithvi and Advanced Air Defence Systems have the capability to intercept ICBMs carrying nuclear, chemical, biological, or conventional warheads.
