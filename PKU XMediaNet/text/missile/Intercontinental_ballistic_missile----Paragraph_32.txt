As the nuclear warhead reenters the Earth's atmosphere its high speed causes compression of the air, leading to a dramatic rise in temperature which would destroy it if it were not shielded in some way. As a result, warhead components are contained within an aluminium honeycomb substructure, sheathed in pyrolytic carbon-epoxy synthetic resin composite material, with a heat shield layer on top which is constructed out of three-dimensional quartz phenolic.
