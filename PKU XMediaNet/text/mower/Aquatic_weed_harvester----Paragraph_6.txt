In August 2015 in Hyderabad, India, an aquatic weed harvester was used to remove algal weeds and trash from Hussainsagar Lake. An amphibious hydraulic excavator was also used. The work was performed to address pollution problems at the lake, which had accumulated significant algae and rubbish such as plastic bags and plastic waste, food wrappers, and various garbage, some of which was floating atop the lake.
