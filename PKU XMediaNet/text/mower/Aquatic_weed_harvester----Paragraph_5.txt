In June 2015 in Uganda, use of the aquatic weed harvester was recommended by the country's Ministry of Agriculture to reduce water hyacinth growth in Lake Victoria, which has caused a scarcity of fish in the lake. The scarcity of fish has negatively-affected the livelihood of locals who live in the lake's region. Additional types of machines were recommended to address the problem, which were the hydraulic harvester, take out elevator and dredger.
