Rice is the main aquatic plant grown for human food, but smaller areas of watercress and water chestnut are also cultivated. In their native environments, aquatic weeds are part of a balanced ecosystem, and it is mainly introduced species of water plant that become invasive and cause problems by congesting water bodies. The worst culprits, found in both temperate and tropical waterways, are floating plants such as water hyacinth, water lettuce and Salvinia, fully submerged rooting plants such as Hydrilla and water milfoil and rooting plants that reach the surface such as cattail, papyrus, bulrush and reed.
