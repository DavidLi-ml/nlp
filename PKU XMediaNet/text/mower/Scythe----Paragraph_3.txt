The cutting edge of a scythe blade is traditionally maintained by occasional peening followed by frequent honing. Peening reforms the malleable edge, by hammering, to create the desired profile, to temper the metal and to remove minor nicks and dents; for mowing fine grass the bevel angle may be peened extremely fine, while for courser work a larger angle is created to give a more robust edge. Peening requires some skill and is done using a peening hammer and special anvils or by using a peening jig. The peened edge is finished by using progressively finer grades of whetstone and subsequently maintained in the field by frequent honing with the whetstone (or rubber), fine-grained for grass, coarser for cereal crops.
