Flymo mowers are powered rotary push lawn mowers that use a fan above the spinning blades to drive air downwards, thereby creating an air cushion that lifts the mower off the ground like a hovercraft. The operator can then more easily move the mower as it floats on this cushion over the grass. Hover mowers are necessarily light in order to achieve the air cushion and typically have plastic bodies with an electric motor. The lack of any wheels enables the mower to be more easily maneuvered around objects.
