Flymo is a hover mower invented by Karl Dahlman. Dahlman invented the mower in 1964 after seeing Sir Christopher Cockerell's Hovercraft machine. "Flymo" is a brand name of the Swedish company Husqvarna AB, formerly a part of Electrolux. The mower is a variation of conventional petrol powered rotary push lawn mowers that uses a fan above the mower's spinning blades to allow the mower to "hover".
