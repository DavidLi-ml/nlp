Mechanical harvesters can be effective at clearing aquatic weeds but the machines are expensive and the process may need to be repeated several times in a growing season. Small fragments of weed remain in the water and may spread to other locations thereby aiding in the dispersal of invasive species. Some areas may be too shallow for the mechanical harvester and it may be unable to access restricted locations. Submerged tree stumps can damage the machine. An alternative to mechanical harvesting is the use of herbicides, which are easy to apply and less expensive, but may have unwanted impacts on the environment.
