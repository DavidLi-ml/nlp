Cordless electric mowers are powered by a variable number (typically 1-4) of 12-volt, 56-volt, and 80-volt rechargeable batteries. Typically, more batteries mean more run time and/or power (and more weight). Batteries can be in the interior of the lawn mower or on the outside. If on the outside, the depleted batteries can be quickly swapped with recharged batteries. Cordless mowers have the maneuverability of a gasoline powered mower and the environmental friendliness of a corded electric mower, but are more expensive and come in fewer models (particularly self-propelling) than either. The eventual disposal of worn-out batteries is problematic (though they can be recycled), and the motors in some cordless mowers tend to be less powerful than gasoline motors of the same total weight (including batteries).
