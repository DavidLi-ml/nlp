"American" style blades use a harder, more brittle, steel than European blades and are not usually peened, or even cannot be peened at all without cracking. The harder blade holds an edge longer and requires less frequent honing in the field but after heavy use or damage the edge must be reshaped by grinding, which subtracts metal, rather reforming the more malleable edge by peening. Some examples have a laminated construction with a hard, brittle, core providing the edge and softer sides providing strength.
