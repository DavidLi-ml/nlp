The original developer of the rollermower is uncertain, but Howard Rotavator Pty Ltd manufactured and sold the 72RLM (later the HS20RLM/180) Rollamowa in Australia from the early 1970s. These were linkage-mounted three-spindled rotary mowers with a cutting width of 1.8m (72‚Äù). A larger version (HS20RLM/300) was also produced before manufacturing ceased in about 1984. The company was absorbed by Howard Australia Pty Ltd and from 1985 sourced its rollermowers from Trimax Industries Ltd (later Trimax Mowing Systems) in New Zealand. Trimax then sold the same machines under the Trimax brand around the world.
