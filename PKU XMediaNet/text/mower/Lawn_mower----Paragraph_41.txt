While considered antiquated in modern times, the original type of push-powered reel mowers are still available. The reel is attached to the mower's wheels by gears, so that when the mower is pushed forward, the reel spins several times faster than the rubber-tired wheels turn. These types of reel mowers offer the benefit of zero pollution being produced. Since all of the energy necessary comes from the user however, this method of mowing is the most strenuous and is not recommended for large lawns. Depending on the placement of the reel, these mowers often cannot cut grass very close to lawn obstacles, like trees, driveways, edging, etc., and also require a very smooth lawn surface to operate properly without bottoming out the cutter bar.
