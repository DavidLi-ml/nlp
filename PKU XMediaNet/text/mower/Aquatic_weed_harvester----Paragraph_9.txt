In 2012 in Leoni, Michigan, an aquatic weed harvester was used to remove algae from Center Lake. The algae appeared to have roots, and other techniques such as attempting to kill it with chemicals were unsuccessful. The machine used collects algae and weeds that live at the bottom of the lake, removing them from the waterway.
