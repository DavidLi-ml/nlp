One modern application of positive displacement pumps is compressed-air-powered double-diaphragm pumps. Run on compressed air these pumps are intrinsically safe by design, although all manufacturers offer ATEX certified models to comply with industry regulation. These pumps are relatively inexpensive and can perform a wide variety of duties, from pumping water out of bunds, to pumping hydrochloric acid from secure storage (dependent on how the pump is manufactured â€“ elastomers / body construction). Lift is normally limited to roughly 6m although heads can reach almost 200 psi (1.4 MPa).
