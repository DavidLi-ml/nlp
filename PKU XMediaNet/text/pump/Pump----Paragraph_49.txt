Such as pump is also referred to as a centrifugal pump. The fluid enters along the axis or center, is accelerated by the impeller and exits at right angles to the shaft (radially); an example is the centrifugal fan, which is commonly used to implement a vacuum cleaner. Generally, a radial-flow pump operates at higher pressures and lower flow rates than an axial- or a mixed-flow pump.
