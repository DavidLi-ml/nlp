Automatic vs. manual operation â€” Selection of a manual sump pump means that one will turn the pump on and off when appropriate. Selecting an automatic sump pump means that a switch is wired to the sump pump to turn it on or off at appropriate water levels. Automatic switches include pressure switches, low level pressure switches, float switches, and a solid state water sensor called field-effect.
