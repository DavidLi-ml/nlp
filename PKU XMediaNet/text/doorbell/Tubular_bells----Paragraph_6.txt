Pink Floyd used tubular bells on The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) on the song "Brain Damage" but are rendered almost inaudible on the original stereo mix and quadrophonic mix. The band's drummer, Nick Mason pointed out that he had forgotten that they were on there until he heard them in the 5.1 surround mix for the 2003 SACD 30th anniversary edition of the album, which has since been released on DVD and BD.
