Rush drummer Neil Peart used tubular bells on the songs "Xanadu" and "Closer to the Heart." He has also used them on concert tours, as heard on the live album Exit...Stage Left and seen on the accompanying video release. On later tours, Peart replaced the tubular bells with a more compact MIDI controller modeled on a marimba, allowing him to reproduce a wide variety of percussion sounds. However, on the band's recent R40 tour, the second set featured a retro 1970's-style kit complete with tubular bells, used on the songs "Jacob's Ladder", "Closer to the Heart" and "Xanadu".
