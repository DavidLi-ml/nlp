Where a bell is powered by AC a different design, the polarised bell, may be used. These have an armature containing a permanent magnet, so that this is alternately attracted and repelled by each half-phase and different polarity of the supply. In practice, the armature is arranged symmetrically with two poles of opposite polarity facing each end of the coil, so that each may be attracted in turn. No contact breaker is required, so the bells are reliable for long service. For this reason they were widely used for telephone bells.
