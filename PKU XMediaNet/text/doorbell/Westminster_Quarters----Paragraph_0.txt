The Westminster Quarters is the most common name for a melody used by a set of clock bells to chime on each quarter-hour. The number of chime sets matches the number of quarter hours that have passed. It is also known as the Westminster Chimes, or the Cambridge Quarters from its place of origin, the church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge.
