In December of 1650 - the settlers of Fort Orange [near present day Albany, New York] played the first recorded round of kolf' [golf]. The Dutch settlers played kolf year round. During the spring, summer and fall it was played in fields. In the winter it was played on ice with the same rules. "On a Monday in December of 1650 a party of men came to his [Steven Jansz] house (house with attached tavern) to drink after having played a round of "kolf" for brandy... Sometime during the drinking session Teunis Jansz Seylemaecker (Sailmaker) accused Steven Jansz' wife Maria (Tavern Keeper) of having 'wiped out two strokes at once' although she had tapped [poured] two "roamers" (green wine glasses) of brandy. Apparently the loser of the match were required to pay the wager to Maria upon arrival at the tavern. She then recorded the amount with chalk on a piece of slate as credit toward the brandy to be consumed by the winners. Each stroke on the slate probably represented two 'roemers' of brandy, or a round for the two men on the winning team." Eventually, the two of the men Philip Pietersz Lademaecker and Steven (Jansz) began fighting, the two other players which included Gijsbert Cornelisz joined. Gijsbert and Steven ended up killing each other over the accusations, but managed to apologize to each other before dying.
