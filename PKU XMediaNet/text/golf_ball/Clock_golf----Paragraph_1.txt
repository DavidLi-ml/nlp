The firm Jaques of London claim that they "originated the popular garden game of Clock Golf in the mid 19th century". The Oxford English Dictionary's earliest illustration of the use of the term dates from 1905. The wording on an early boxed set of equipment was "Clock Golf - A new game for the lawn - Interesting to golfers and a most popular amusement at garden parties".
