Washer dryer combinations are normally built with a number of sensors and systems to automate much of the washing and drying cycles. Some of the higher model washer dryer combos have sensors that monitor water level, suds levels, temperature levels, and garment dryness. The information gathered by these sensors are used to control the spin speed, cycle settings, draining systems, operational noise, and other functions.
