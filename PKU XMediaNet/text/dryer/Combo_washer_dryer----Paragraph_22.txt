Washer dryer combo units not using a heat pump have also been criticized because they are not as efficient as some of the stand-alone machines. For these machines, longer drying times of washer dryer combos also make it difficult to increase efficiency, because the machine has to stay in operation for much longer than a stand-alone dryer does. On the other hand, in heat-pump washer dryers energy is recovered, and it enables energy saving of about 50%.
