In New Zealand Self Service Laundries are available, but not widely used. The NZ culture tends to be reserved with in house laundry facilities, but with the rise in apartment dwellers this is slowing. Most houses also operate their own dryer as the temperate climate can have often unpredictable downpours. There is a rise in delivered laundry and ironing services as NZ's better off are starting to outsource in line with the value of their time.
