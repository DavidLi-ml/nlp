Another potential benefit of combo washer dryers, compared to larger, separate machines, is portability. Some models have wheels that make it easy to move them in and out of different rooms, cabinets, or closets, and the ability to operate without dedicated gas or electrical outlets nor exhaust ducts also makes installing or relocating a machine easier (non-condensing ventless machines can cause humidity problems, however). Some of these machines have even been installed in recreational vehicles.
