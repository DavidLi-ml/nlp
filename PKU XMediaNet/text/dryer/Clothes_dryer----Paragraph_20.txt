A hand-cranked clothes dryer was created in 1800 by M. Pochon from France. J. Ross Moore, an American inventor from North Dakota, developed designs for automatic clothes dryers during the early 20th century. His design for an electrically-operated dryer was developed and released to the public in 1938. Industrial designer Brooks Stevens developed the first electric dryer with a glass window in the 1940s.
