Typically in separate-condenser dryers, cool air is used to cool down the process air from the inside drum and to condense the vapor. In combined washer dryer units, however, cold water is used instead. The water flows in the opposite direction to the air, allowing the air to cool and to release its moisture, which is pumped out along with the water used to cool the air. These machines normally take longer than regular dryers, because the combo unit has a smaller drum, so there is less volume to allow air circulation and the drum itself must be dried immediately after a wash cycle . This water-fed drying system consumes water for both the washing and drying phases of operation, and may not be suitable for ares where water is scarce.
