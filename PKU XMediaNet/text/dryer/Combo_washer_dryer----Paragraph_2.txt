Washer dryer combinations are a type of home appliance that handles the basic laundering duties of washing and drying clothes. These machines are often referred to as "combo washer dryers" or "all-in-one washer dryers," but basically the washer dryer combo is the size of a standard or compact washing machine, but is able to perform both washing and drying functions. Designed to handle different types of fabric and garments such as clothes, sheets, and towels, washer dryer combos usually have functions such as temperature controls, customizable cycle controls, and ventless systems. While combo washer dryers are not as effective and efficient as some full-sized, fully functional, separate washer and dryer machines, the combos provide a viable option for those who can benefit from having a compact machine that is able to wash and dry clothes.
