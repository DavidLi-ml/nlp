Washateria is an alternate name for laundromat, especially in Texas. The first washateria so named was opened in 1936 in Fort Worth, Texas by Noah Brannen. Though steam-powered laundry machines were invented in the 19th century, their cost put them out of reach of many. Brennan and others began renting short-term use of their machines. Most laundromats and washaterias in the United States are fully automated and coin-operated and generally unmanned, with many (but not all) operating 24 hours a day.
