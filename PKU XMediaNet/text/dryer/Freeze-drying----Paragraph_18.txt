Freeze-dried pharmaceutical products are produced as lyophilized powders for reconstitution in vials and more recently in prefilled syringes for self-administration by a patient. Many biopharmaceutical products based on therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies require lyophilization for stability. Examples of lyophilized biopharmaceuticals include blockbuster drugs such as Etanercept (Enbrel by Pfizer), Infliximab (Remicade by Janssen Biotech), Rituximab and Trastuzumab (Herceptin by Genentech).
