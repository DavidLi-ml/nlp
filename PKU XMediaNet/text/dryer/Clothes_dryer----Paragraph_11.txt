A closed-cycle heat pump clothes dryer uses a heat pump to dehumidify the processing air. Such dryers typically use less than half the energy per load of a condenser dryer. Whereas condensation dryers use a passive heat exchanger cooled by ambient air, these dryers use a heat pump. The hot, humid air from the tumbler is passed through a heat pump where the cold side condenses the water vapor into either a drain pipe or a collection tank and the hot side reheats the air afterwards for re-use. In this way not only does the dryer avoid the need for ducting, but it also conserves much of its heat within the dryer instead of exhausting it into the surroundings. Heat pump dryers can therefore use up to 50% less energy required by either condensation or traditional dryers. Domestic heat pump dryers are designed to work in typical ambient temperatures from 5 to 30 °C. Below 5 °C, drying times significantly increase.
