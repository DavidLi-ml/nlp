In the past combo washer dryer capacity was generally smaller than that of full-size washers, and it also took much longer to process a load of laundry. Currently available washer-dryers are able to wash 9 kilograms (20 lb) and dry 6 kilograms (13 lb) (nominal rating); they are fully comparable to standard washing machines and tumble dryers. Since washing 9 kg of clothes is quite uncommon for ordinary customers, one can wash&dry even large loads with satisfactory performances. Nevertheless many users say they take out some wet laundry and dry their clothes in two batches to speed drying time. User review sites such as Epinions.com are full of owners who say drying times are long (even if comparable to standard heat pump tumble dryers), and this is one reason why most washer-dryer combos get poorer reviews than full-size washers and dryers.
