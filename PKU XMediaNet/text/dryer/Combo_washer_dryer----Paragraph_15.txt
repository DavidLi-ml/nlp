AEG-Electrolux debuted the first heat pump washer-dryer combo unit at IFA Berlin, September 2013 (AEG Okokombi). Commercialization of this product started in April, 2014, and it is currently available in whole Europe. Main benefits with respect to standard washer-dryers are low-temperature drying (and thus, improved fabric care); energy efficiency, since it uses 40% less electricity compared to standard A-class washer-dryers (according to EU energy label) [1]. AEG Okokombi is currently produced at Electrolux Porcia Plant (Italy), where it was designed and industrialized by local R&D, and it is still the only heatpump washer-dryer on European Market, while Toshiba offers a similar product (even if not compatible to European standards) in Asia.
