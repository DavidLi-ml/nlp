The main benefit of washer dryer combination units is their compactness. The small size of these machines compared to the total space consumed by a separate washer and dryer suits them to small homes, apartments, condominiums, and any place where space is an issue. Aside from having a small footprint, combo units also have a small height, allowing them to fit into confined places, like under a kitchen counter or in a closet.
