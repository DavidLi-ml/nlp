Before the invention of the hair dryer, it was common for men and women to dry their hair using a vacuum cleaner. In 1890 the first hairdryer was invented by french stylist, Alexander Godefroy. His invention was a large, seated version that consisted of a bonnet that attatched to the chimney pipe of a gas stove. Godefoy invented it for use in his hair salon in France and it was not portable or handheld, but instead could only be used by having the person sit underneath it.
