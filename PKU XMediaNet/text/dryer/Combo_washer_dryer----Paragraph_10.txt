In recent years alternative methods of cooling the condenser have emerged. In 2013 Beko introduced "Air Cool" drying, which rather than using water to cool the condenser, uses air drawn from outside the machine via a vent in the front panel. The manufacturer claimed this would save up to 95 bath-tub-fulls of water per year.
