Despite having been designed to be used against equipment, the rifles also proved useful in dispatching enemy personnel from superior range, including enemy snipers. This, however, requires that the enemy cannot use arms with similar effective range - which e.g. was the case during the War on Terror in Afghanistan. The latter theater is the site of the farthest scored hit with an AMR in combat.
