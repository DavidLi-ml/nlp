When installed, barrels are often free-floated: i.e., installed so that the barrel contacts the rest of the rifle only at the receiver, to minimise the effects on impact point of pressure on the fore-end by slings, bipods, or the sniper's hands. The end of the barrel is usually crowned or machined to form a rebated area around the muzzle proper to avoid asymmetry or damage, and consequent inaccuracy. Alternatively, some rifles, such as the Dragunov or Walther WA2000, provide structures at the fore-end to provide tension on the barrel in order to counteract barrel drop and other alterations in barrel shape.
