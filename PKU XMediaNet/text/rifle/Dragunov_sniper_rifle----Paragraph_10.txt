Several other models of the PSO sight are available with varying levels of magnification and alternative aiming reticules. Rifles designated SVDN come equipped with a night sight, such as the NSP-3, NSPU, PGN-1, NSPUM or the Polish passive PCS-5. Rifles designated SVDN-1 can use the multi-model night scope NSPU-3 (1PN51) and rifles designated SVDN2 can use the multi-model night scope NSPUM (1PN58). Non military issue commercially available adaptor mounts that attach to the Warsaw Pact side rail allow use of Picatinny rail-mounted aiming optics.
