The Dragunov has a vented, two-piece wooden handguard/gas tube cover and a skeletonized wooden thumbhole stock equipped with a detachable cheek rest; the latter is removed when using iron sights. Newer production models feature synthetic furniture made of a black polymer â€“ the handguard and gas tube cover are more or less identical in appearance, while the thumbhole stock is of a different shape.
