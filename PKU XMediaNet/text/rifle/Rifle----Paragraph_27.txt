The original Grizzly fired a single shot before breaking. Grizzly 2.0 fired fourteen bullets before getting damaged due to the strain. According to the Daily Mail, the Grizzly 2.0 performed so well that the inventor "Matthew" was able to put the rifle to his shoulder, pressed against his cheek, and shoot off three rounds without hurting himself.
