The most common type is the B♭ trumpet, but A, C, D, E♭, E, low F, and G trumpets are also available. The C trumpet is most common in American orchestral playing, where it is used alongside the B♭ trumpet. Its slightly smaller size gives it a brighter sound and crisper articulation. Orchestra trumpet players are generally adept at transposing music at sight, sometimes playing music written for the A, B♭, D, E♭, E, or F trumpet on the C trumpet or B♭ trumpet.
