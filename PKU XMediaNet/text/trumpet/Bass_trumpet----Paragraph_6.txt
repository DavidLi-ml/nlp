The bass trumpet is usually notated in the treble clef. The bass trumpet in C sounds one octave lower than written, the bass trumpet in E♭ sounds a major sixth lower than written and the bass trumpet in B♭ sounds a major ninth lower than written. Wagner's transpositions include bass trumpet in E, E♭, D, C and B♭, though players often have parts for the bass trumpet transposed into C to play on the C bass trumpet.
