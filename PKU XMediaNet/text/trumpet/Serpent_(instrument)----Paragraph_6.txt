In the 1970s, instrument-maker Christopher Monk began playing, and later making Serpents, and in 1976 he founded the London Serpent Trio. Since then, the instrument has undergone a revival of sorts. In 1987, Simon Proctor wrote the first concerto for the instrument. The Serpent Concerto was first performed on October 21, 1989 at the First International Serpent Festival (celebrating the 399th anniversary of the serpent) with serpent soloist Alan Lumsden. Since then, the Serpent Concerto has been performed in public on many occasions, most notably by Douglas Yeo of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops Orchestra, who played the solo part with the Boston Pops under the direction of John Williams. The concerto appears on a commercial CD recording, Le Monde du Serpent (The World of the Serpent), on the Berlioz Historic Brass label, BHB 101, with the Berlioz Historical Brass, Gloria Dei Cantores choir, members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra et al. In 2008, Douglas Yeo premiered another serpent concerto, "Old Dances in New Shoes" by Washington D.C.â€“based composer Gordon Bowie, with the Boston Classical Orchestra, conducted by Steven Lipsitt.
