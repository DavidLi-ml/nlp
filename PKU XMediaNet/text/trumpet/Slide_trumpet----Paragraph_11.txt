The Firebird trumpet is the most recent example of a slide trumpet, and first went into production in 1983. It is a three-valve trumpet with an angled bell and the addition of a trombone-style slide. It was invented by jazz musician Maynard Ferguson (who first commissioned and played the instrument) and instrument designer Larry Ramirez. While still a specialist instrument, it has a slowly growing number of players.
