A trumpet concerto is a concerto for solo trumpet and instrumental ensemble, customarily the orchestra. Such works have been written from the Baroque period, when the solo concerto form was first developed, up through the present day. Some major composers have contributed to the trumpet concerto repertoire, with the best known work being Joseph Haydn's Trumpet Concerto in E-flat.
