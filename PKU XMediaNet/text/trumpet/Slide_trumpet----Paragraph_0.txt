The slide trumpet is a type of trumpet that is fitted with a slide much like a trombone. Eventually, the slide trumpet evolved into the sackbut, which evolved into the modern-day trombone. The key difference between these two instruments is that the slide trumpet possesses only a single slide joint, rather than the double slide joint of the sackbut / trombone.
