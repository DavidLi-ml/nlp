From its beginning as an instrument held vertically between one's knees with both palms facing down, Hermenge (in his serpent method - Paris, 1817) suggested a horizontal playing position that rested in the right hand palm faced upward. This position was adopted by English military serpents and the instrument was made of a more robust construction (owing to marching or riding on horseback) with thicker walls of the wood and metal stays between the "S" bends of the serpent. The "English bass horn" was a variant form of upright serpent of metal consisting of a tube folded back on itself (rather like the modern bassoon). Mendelssohn scored for the English bass horn in the first edition of his "Midsummer Night's Dream" although the ophicleide was substituted with his consent after the English bass horn fell rapidly from favor. The Italian form of upright serpent, or corno di basso, came to be abbreviated as "gimbasso" or "cimbasso" or other variants, which even today leads to great confusion with a modern "cimbasso," a contrabass valve trombone.
