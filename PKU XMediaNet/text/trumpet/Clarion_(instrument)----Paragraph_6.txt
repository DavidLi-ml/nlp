The confusion over the usage of these terms seemed to mainly dissipate in the Baroque era, when "clarino" (plural: "clarini"), and its variants, came to be specifically understood as the practice of playing the natural trumpet in its high register. The principal register of the instrument extends to the seventh pitch of the harmonic series. The clarino register runs from the eighth to the twentieth pitch in the series.
