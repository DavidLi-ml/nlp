HMS Serpent (1887) was a torpedo cruiser launched in 1887 and wrecked in November 1890 near Camari√±as with the loss of 173 of her crew of 176 men. The cause was an error in judgment on the part of those responsible for the ship's navigation. Still, her officers and men obeyed orders and maintained good discipline to the end, with her officers obeying the Captain's orders to "stand by the ship", and going down with her.
