Japanese sword makers developed the secret technique of differential hardening by covering their sword blades in different thicknesses of clay. The thinner clay allowed the heated metal to cool faster when quenched. Also, the thinner metal of the edge cooled faster than the spine. The faster cooled metal had a finer crystal structure which along with being harder also allowed polishing the blade to reveal the pattern between the fast and slow cooled steel. As well, the different types of steel had different densities which led to the blade, straight or almost straight blade before quenching, to becoming curved. For this reason it was necessary when quenching to plunge the blade straight into the quenching fluid as a blade that went in at a different angle could curve to the side and be rendered utterly useless. European sword makers produced similar results using differential tempering.
