A claymore (/ˈkleɪmɔər/; from Scottish Gaelic claidheamh-mòr, "great sword") refers either to the Scottish variant of the late medieval two-handed sword or the Scottish variant of the basket-hilted sword. The former is characterised as having a cross hilt of forward-sloping quillons with quatrefoil terminations and was in use from the 15th to 17th centuries.
