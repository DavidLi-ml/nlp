In the video game Minecraft, the Rapier is a weapon that is part of the Tinker's construct mod. The mod allows you to create customizable tools and weapons. "While the Rapier's damage is low, it makes up for this with its other abilities. The Rapier is the fastest weapon, allowing you to attack as fast as you can click. Right-clicking with it will cause you to jump back a block. It also ignores all armor, making it excellent for PvP".
