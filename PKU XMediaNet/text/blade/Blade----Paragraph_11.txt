As native copper was available, ancient civilizations started to use it. Though copper is soft for a metal, and would easily deform, it would not hold an edge well and was poorly suited for working stone, though was more durable than earlier materials. Bronze was a superior, later development, though still quite soft for a metal. Both bronze and copper can be work hardened by hitting the metal with a hammer. Iron replaced bronze once sufficient smelting technology was achieved to reach iron's melting point. Steel, a series of alloys made from iron, became the metal of choice in the modern age which displays far superior qualities than iron.
