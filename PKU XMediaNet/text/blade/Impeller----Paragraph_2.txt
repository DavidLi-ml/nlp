The impeller made out of cast material in many cases may be called rotor, also. It is cheaper to cast the radial impeller right in the support it is fitted on, which is put in motion by the gearbox from an electric motor, combustion engine or by steam driven turbine. The rotor usually names both the spindle and the impeller when they are mounted by bolts.
