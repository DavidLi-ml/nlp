Authors arguing that the basket-hilted sword is "incorrectly" called claymore have been known to suggest that claybeg (from a purported Gaelic claidheamh-beag "small sword") should be used instead. This term is not seen in clan-era Gaelic song or poetry, Dwelly's [ibid.], or other authorities, and seems to be a fairly recent invention.
