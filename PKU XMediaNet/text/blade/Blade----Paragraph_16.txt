The more acute the blade the more easily it will dull. As the blade is thin there is little material to remove from the fine edge before the edge is worn away to a thicker section. Also, thin blades will fracture easily. Thin edges are also very weak and the edge can literally roll over when force is applied it to and form something like the bottom part of a letter "J". Straight edge razors, for example, are frequently stropped not to grind metal from the edge but to straighten the edge. Sharpening blades by grinding the edge thin to such a degree that a burr results on the side of the edge away from the stone. This burr, like the rolled edge of a straight edge razor or other knife, can be felt by running the finger from the spine to the edge and it will only be felt on the curled side. Steeling, whether on a grooved or smooth steel or even very gentle pressure on a curved stone, can straighten this roll as can stropping.
