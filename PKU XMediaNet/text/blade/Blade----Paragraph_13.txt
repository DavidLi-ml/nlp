It is possible to combine different materials, or different heat treatments, to produce desirable qualities in a blade. For example, the finest Japanese swords were routinely made of up to seven sections of metals and even poorer quality swords were often made of two. These would include soft irons that could absorb the energy of impact without fracturing but which would bend and poorly retain an edge, and hard steels more liable to shatter on impact but which retained an edge well. The combination provided a sword that would resist impact, even though the edge could chip if abused, and while remaining sharp. Pattern welding involved forging together twisted bars of soft (bendable) low carbon and hard (brittle) higher carbon iron. This was done as historically furnaces were typically able to produce only one grade or the other and neither was well suited for more than a very limited use blade. The ability of modern steel makers to produce very high quality steels of various compositions has largely relegated this technique to either historical recreations or to artistic masterpieces. Once acid etched and polished the pattern produced by the different grades of metal used is revealed with skilled craftsmen either to produce seemingly random patterns single instances of a symbol or regular and highly intricate patterns largely arbitrarily. These can include figures resembling parallel lines, leaves, crosses, herringbone, fleur-de-lis, concentric circles/squares etc. or even the smith's initials repeated minutely across the blade's surface and combinations of all these.
