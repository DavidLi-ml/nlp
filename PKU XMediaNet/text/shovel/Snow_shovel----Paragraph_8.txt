Shoveling snow is hard work. In a single winter, shoveling a typical driveway can involve moving more than 25 tons of snow. Health risks associated with shoveling snow include heart attacks (myocardial infarction), worsening of existing breathing issues, sprains and strains, slips and falls, back injuries, hypothermia and frostbite, and accidents involving road traffic.
