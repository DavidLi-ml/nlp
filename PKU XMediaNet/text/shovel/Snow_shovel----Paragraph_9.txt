Persons doing snow shoveling can reduce their risk of injury by shoveling snow when it is fresh and light. Slip-resistant boots protect against user falls. Appropriate clothing prevents hypothermia and frostbite. Ideal snow shoveling clothing for the rest of the body is lightweight, layered, and water-repellent to increase ventilation while maintaining insulation.
