Proper snow throwing technique minimizes strains and back injuries. Recommended technique is that when lifting snow, the user bends their knees to collect the snow while maintaining a straight back, then straightening the legs to stand and lift. It is best to lift snow by using the shovel as a lever. Never lift snow with a side-twisting motion, as that can lead to injury.
