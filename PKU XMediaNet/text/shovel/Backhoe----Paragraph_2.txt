A backhoe loader is a tractor-like vehicle with a backhoe at one end, a front loader on the other and a swivelling seat to position the operator facing whichever he is using at the time. In North America, this arrangement is often referred to as simply a backhoe or, when on a chassis originally derived from farm tractors, a tractor loader backhoe (TLB). To differentiate, a backhoe on its own dedicated chassis may then be referred to as an "excavator", although strictly, that word includes all types of machine designed to excavate.
