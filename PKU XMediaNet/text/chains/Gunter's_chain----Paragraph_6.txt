Although Gunter's chain was later superseded by the steel tape (a form of tape measure), its legacy was a new unit of length called the chain, which measured 66 feet (or 100 links). This unit still exists as a location identifier on British railways, as well as in some areas of America. In the United States, for example, Public Lands Survey plats are published in the chain unit to maintain the consistency of a two-hundred-year-old database. Minor roads surveyed in Australia and new Zealand were in the 19th and early 20th centuries customarily one chain wide.
