Door chains installed on hollow-core doors, or that are not anchored into solid materials (such as the wood door frame) do not provide protection. This is because the chain can easily be defeated by pushing on a door. The chains are helpful to sound an alert to the person inside that someone is breaking through a door. The noise may be heard by the occupants giving them time to call for help, escape via another exit, or get a weapon to protect themselves. Door chains are also sometimes used to slow down mentally-challenged individuals who may attempt to exit from inside a structure.
