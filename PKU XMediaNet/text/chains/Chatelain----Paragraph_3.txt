This variation was most marked in the cities, where in the struggle for power that of the ch창telain depended on the success with which he could assert himself against his feudal superior, lay or ecclesiastical, or, from the 12th century onwards, against the rising power of the communes. The ch창tellenie (casteliania), or jurisdiction of the ch창telain, as a territorial division for certain judicial and administrative purposes, survived the disappearance of the title and office of the ch창telain in France, and continued till the Revolution.
