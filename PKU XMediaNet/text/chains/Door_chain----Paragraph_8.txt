Security screen doors add a second set of hinges or locks to defeat before access to a structure can be granted. If the intention is to keep thieves out, or keep disturbed individuals in, this is a better solution. Security screen doors also make it possible to open the main door, and communicate with those outside. Some even have mail slots. As an added benefit, security screen doors can allow the door to be opened, and provide for secure ventilation. The main downside is the cost, which is generally about as much as a regular door, and locks are usually sold separately. Installation can also be difficult, as the doorknobs of the two doors may interfere with each other, and the screen material usually interferes with any peephole devices on the door.
