The semi-chisel chain has teeth with rounded corners formed by a radius between the top and side plates. While slower than full chisel in softwood, it retains an acceptable cutting sharpness longer, making it the preferred choice for dirtier wood, hard or dry wood, frozen wood or stump work, all of which would rapidly degrade full chisel chain. Variation of the semi-chain is "Chamfer chisel" chains by made by Oregon. They are similar to semi-chisel design but have a small 45 degree chamfer between the plates rather than a radius. Performance is similar to good semi-chisel. Semi chisel chains have a lower kick-back risk. These chains are are availabe for consumer, semi-pro and professional saws.
