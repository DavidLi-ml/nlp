Twenty half-links in a new chain measure 10 inches (254 mm), and replacement is recommended before the old chain measures 10 1⁄16 inches (256 mm) (0.7% wear). A safer time to replace a chain is when 24 half-links in the old chain measure 12 1⁄16 inches (306 mm) (0.5% wear). If the chain has worn beyond this limit, the rear sprockets are also likely to wear, in extreme cases followed by the front chainrings. In this case, the 'skipping' mentioned above is liable to continue even after the chain is replaced, as the teeth of the sprockets will have become unevenly worn (in extreme cases, hook-shaped). Replacing worn sprocket cassettes and chainrings after missing the chain replacement window is much more expensive than simply replacing a worn chain.
