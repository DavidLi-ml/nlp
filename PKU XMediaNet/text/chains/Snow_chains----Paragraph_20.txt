Most tire chains are wrapped around the circumference of the tires and held in place with rim chains, which may be chain or cable, elastic or adjustable tensioners. Automatic chains do not wrap around the tire but swing under the tire from devices permanently mounted under the vehicle which deploy via an electronic solenoid activated in the cab. Spikes-Spider (registered trade-mark) mount onto the tires from one side. WeatherClaws (registered trademark) uses a ratcheting system for easier installation.
