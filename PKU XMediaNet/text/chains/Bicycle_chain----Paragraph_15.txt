Chains come in either 3⁄32 in (2.4 mm), 1⁄8 in (3.2 mm), 5⁄32 in (4.0 mm), or 3⁄16 in (4.8 mm) roller widths, the internal width between the inner plates. 1⁄8 in (3.2 mm) chains are used on bikes with a single rear sprocket: those with coaster brakes, hub gears, fixed gears such as track bicycles, or BMX bikes. Chains with 3⁄32 in (2.4 mm) wide rollers are used on bikes with derailleurs such as racing, touring, and mountain bikes. Fixed sprockets and freewheels are also available in 3⁄32 in (2.4 mm) widths so fixed-gear and single-speed bikes can be set up to use narrow and lighter 3⁄32 in (2.4 mm) chains. Finally, chains with 5⁄32 in (4.0 mm) wide rollers are used on freight bicycles and tricycles.
