A typical bicycle chain (for derailleur gears) uses narrow 1/2" pitch chain. The width of the chain is variable, and does not affect the load capacity. The more sprocket wheels at the back wheels confined space (historically 3-6, actually 7, 8, 9 or even 10 speeds) the narrower the chain. Hub gear or single speed bicycles use 1/2" x 1/8" chains.
