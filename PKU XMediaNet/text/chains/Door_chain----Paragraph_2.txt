Door chains also can be set in place when the door does not need to be opened. They can only be touched from outside when the door has been opened, and therefore, if the locks on the door are compromised, a door chain may cause some delay, draw more attention, or leave more evidence of force being used when gaining unauthorized access to the structure.
