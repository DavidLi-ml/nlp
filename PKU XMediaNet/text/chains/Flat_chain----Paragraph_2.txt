Today, flat chain is used most often for conveyor belts, because it lends itself well to the attachment of slats, flights, buckets, and prongs used to move material. Such attachments can be welded on in the field, or can be purchased ready-made on a single link (or pair of links where the conveyor uses two chains) and then spliced into a loop of chain.
