A door bar is a newer device intended to replace door chains. It consists of a U shaped bar that attaches to a hinge on the doorframe, and a knob on the door. The bar swings over the knob to restrict the full opening of the door. Door bars are easier to use, and can be made of much sturdier material than door chains. Also, door bars cannot be defeated in the same way that door chains can be, although they can be defeated just as easily in different ways.
