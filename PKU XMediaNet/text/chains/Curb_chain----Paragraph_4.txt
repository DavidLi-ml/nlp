There are two undesirable consequences when using a very tight curb chain. First, the bit immediately exerts curb pressure and increased pressure on the bars as soon as pressure is applied to the reins. Therefore, a tight curb chain is much harsher, and provides less finesse in signaling the horse than a looser curb chain would, as the horse is never given a chance to respond before the curb chain engages. Secondly, an extremely tight curb chain causes the mouthpiece to constantly push down on the sensitive tongue, never allowing the horse relief.
