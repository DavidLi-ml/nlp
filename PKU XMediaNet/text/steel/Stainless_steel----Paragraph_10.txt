Some 3D printing providers have developed proprietary stainless steel sintering blends for use in rapid prototyping. One of the more popular stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel manufactured via 3D printing tends to have more refined microstructures. This in turn results in better mechanical properties; however, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti6Al4V in the 3D printing industry, this is because stainless steel manufactured via the traditional methods tends to be more economically competitive.
