In the beginning stainless steel was sold in the US under different brand names like "Allegheny metal" and "Nirosta steel". Even within the metallurgy industry the eventual name remained unsettled; in 1921 one trade journal was calling it "unstainable steel." In 1929, before the Great Depression hit, over 25,000 tons of stainless steel were manufactured and sold in the US.
