Strength/weight ratio - Construction materials are commonly categorized by their strength to weight ratio, or specific strength. This is defined as the strength of a material over its density. This gives an engineer an indication as to how useful the material is in comparison to its weight, with the weight being a direct indication of its cost (typically) and ease of construction. Concrete is typically ten times stronger in compression than in tension, giving it a higher strength to weight ratio in compression, only.
