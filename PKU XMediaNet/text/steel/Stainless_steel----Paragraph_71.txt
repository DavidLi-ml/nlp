Despite its design and use, stainless steel can still be susceptible to corrosion, some grades more than others, and especially in corrosive environments. Challenging environments include saline environments, such as coastal areas where regular exposure to sea salt is common and areas where de-icing salts are common during winter. Manufacturing environments, especially in chemical and food industries, may also be subject to corrosive substances.
