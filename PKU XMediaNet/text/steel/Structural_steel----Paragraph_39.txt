Sustainability - Many construction companies and material vendors are making changes to be a more environmentally friendly company. Sustainability has become an entirely new consideration for materials that are to be placed into the environment for generations of time. A sustainable material will be one that has minimal effect on the environment, both at the time of installation as well as throughout the life cycle of the material. Reinforced concrete and structural steel both have the ability to be a sustainable construction option, if used properly. Over 80% of structural steel members fabricated today come from recycled metals, called A992 steel. This member material is cheaper, as well as having a higher strength to weight ratio, than previously used steel members (A36 grade). Reinforced concrete can also be a very sustainable option. Concrete's material components are naturally occurring materials that are not harmful to the environment. Also, concrete can now be poured to be permeable, allowing the flow of water through a paved surface and therefore reducing the necessary infrastructural construction that causes further potential disturbance to the environment. Concrete can also be crushed and used as aggregate in future concrete applications, meaning it doesn't necessarily have to be used as a land fill.
