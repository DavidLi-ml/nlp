Fire resistance - One of the most dangerous hazards to a building is a fire hazard. This is especially true in dry, windy climates and for structures constructed using wood. Special considerations must be taken into account with structural steel to ensure it is not under a dangerous fire hazard condition. Reinforced concrete characteristically does not pose a threat in the event of fire and even resists the spreading of fire, as well as temperature changes. This makes concrete an excellent insulation, improving the sustainability of the building it surrounds by reducing the required energy to maintain climate.
