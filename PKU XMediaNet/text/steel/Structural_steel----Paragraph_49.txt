Constructability - Structural steel can be developed into nearly any shape, which are either bolted or welded together in construction. Structural steel can be erected as soon as the materials are delivered on site, whereas concrete must be cured at least 1â€“2 weeks after pouring before construction can continue, making steel a schedule-friendly construction material.
