The reputation of Seric iron of South India (wootz steel) amongst the rest of the world grew considerably. South Indian and Mediterranean sources including Alexander the Great (3rd c. BC) recount the presentation and export to the Greeks of 100 talents worth of such steel. Metal production sites in Sri Lanka employed wind furnaces driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Large-scale Wootz steel production in Tamilakam using crucibles and carbon sources such as the plant AvƒÅram occurred by the sixth century BC, the pioneering precursor to modern steel production and metallurgy.
