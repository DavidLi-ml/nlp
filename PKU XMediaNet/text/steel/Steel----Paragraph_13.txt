When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a eutectoid steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of the mixture attempts to revert to the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite that is able to hold the carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries and then when the composition left behind is eutectoid, the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form until the remaining composition is 0.8% at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.
