Corrosion - When choosing a structural material, it is important to consider the life cycle of the building. Some materials are susceptible to corrosion from their surrounding elements, such as water, heat, humidity, or salt. Special considerations must be taken into account during the installation of a structural material to prevent any potential corrosion hazards. This must also be made clear to the occupants of the building because there may or may not be a necessary maintenance requirement to prevent corrosion. For example, structural steel cannot be exposed to the environment because any moisture, or other contact with water, will cause it to rust. When the steel rusts it compromises the structural integrity of the building and poses a potential danger to the residual or surrounding occupants.
