The first known mention of the game was in the book Wuzazu (traditional Chinese: 五雜組; simplified Chinese: 五杂组) by the Chinese Ming-dynasty writer Xie Zhaozhi (traditional Chinese: 謝肇淛; simplified Chinese: 谢肇淛; fl. ca. 1600), who wrote that the game dated back to the time of the Chinese Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD). In the book, the game was called shoushiling (traditional Chinese: 手勢令; simplified Chinese: 手势令; literally: "hand command"). Li Rihua's (traditional Chinese: 李日華; simplified Chinese: 李日华) book Note of Liuyanzhai (traditional Chinese: 六硯齋筆記; simplified Chinese: 六砚斋笔记) also mentions this game, calling it shoushiling (traditional Chinese: 手勢令; simplified Chinese: 手势令; literally: "hand command"), huozhitou (Chinese: 豁指头), or huoquan (Chinese: 豁拳).
