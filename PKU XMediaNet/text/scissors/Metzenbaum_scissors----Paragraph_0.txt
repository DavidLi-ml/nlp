Metzenbaum scissors are surgical scissors designed for cutting delicate tissue and blunt dissection. The scissors come in variable lengths and have a relatively long shank-to-blade ratio. They are constructed of stainless steel and may have tungsten carbide cutting surface inserts. Blades can be curved or straight. The blade tips are usually blunt. This is most common in organ operations. It is also used in heart operations.
