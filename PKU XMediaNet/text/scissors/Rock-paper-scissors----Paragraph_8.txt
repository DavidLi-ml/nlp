The Paper Scissors Stone Club was founded in London, England in 1842. The charter appeared in Edition 1, Volume 1, of the club's publication, The Stone Scissors Paper. It read,"The club is dedicated to the exploration and dissemination of knowledge regarding the game of Paper Scissors Stone and providing a safe legal environment for the playing of said game." In 1918, the club's name was changed to World RPS Club. Soon after that, the club moved its headquarters to Toronto, Canada. In 1925, the club had more than 10,000 active members, changed its name the World RPS Society, and hosted its first annual championship.
