Hair-cutting shears are scissors that are specifically designed for cutting hair. They are also known as barber shears, hairdressing shears, or hair shears. Hair-cutting shears are significantly sharper than scissors, and designed specifically for cutting hair. Shears range in size from about 5 to 7 inches (13 to 18 cm) long. They commonly have an appendage, known as a finger brace or tang, attached to one of the finger rings. This gives the user additional control when cutting.
