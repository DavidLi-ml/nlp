A specialized type of hair-cutting shears known as texturizing shears are used to reduce hair thickness, to create special texturizing effects, or to blend layered hair. Texturizing shears have a pair of pivoted blades in the same way as normal shears, but one or both blades have teeth on the edge like a comb. Texturing shears may also be called "thinning shears" or "chunking shears".
