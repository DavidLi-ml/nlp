Modern commercial broilers, for example, Cornish crosses and Cornish-Rocks, are artificially selected and bred for large-scale, efficient meat production and although they are the same species, grow much faster than egg laying hens or traditional dual purpose breeds. They are noted for having very fast growth rates, a high feed conversion ratio, and low levels of activity. Modern commercial broilers are bred to reach a slaughter-weight of about 2 kg in only 35 to 49 days. Slow growing free-range and organic strains have been developed which reach slaughter-weight at 12 to 16 weeks of age. As a consequence, the behaviour and physiology of broilers reared for meat are those of immature birds, rather than adults.
