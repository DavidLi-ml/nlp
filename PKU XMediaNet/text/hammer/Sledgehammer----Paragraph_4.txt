Sledgehammers are increasingly being used as inexpensive exercise equipment; since all major upper body muscle groups need to put forth a significant amount of force when swinging a sledgehammer, it can easily be used to work muscles to failure as in resistance training. A tire is often used as the hammer's target as its elasticity reduces the shock to the user's joints when used for this purpose.
