The soft-faced hammers have heads faced with brass, lead, tightly wound rawhide, or plastic. These hammers usually have replaceable heads or faces, because they will deform, wear out, or break over time. They are used to prevent damage to a struck surface, and are graded by the weight of the head and by hardness of the striking face.
