Rubber mallets are used when a softer blow is called for than that delivered by a metal hammer. They are typically used to form sheet metal, since they do not leave marks and are less likely to dent the workpiece. Rubber mallets are also used for forcing tight-fitting parts together, for shifting plasterboard into place, in upholstery work, and a variety of other general purposes. It is a tool of preference for wood workers using chisels with plastic, metal, or wooden handles, as they give a softened strike with a positive drive. It is the most commonly used mallet.
