On the British daytime shows TV-AM and GMTV, and in the spinoff children's shows hosted by Timmy Mallet, a game was played called "Mallet's Mallet" where a participant had to associate words in a certain time period. Failing contestants were hit on the head by Mallet, using a soft pink and yellow mallet with black "Mallet's Mallet" writing on both sides. The person who got hit then had a sticking plaster affixed to their head by Mallet.
