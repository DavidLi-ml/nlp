Spike mauls are akin to the sledge hammer, typically weighing from 8 to 12 pounds (3.6 to 5.4 kg) with a 30 to 36 inches (76 to 91 cm) long handle. They have an elongated double faced hardened steel head. The head is typically over 12 inches (30 cm) long to allow the user to drive spikes on the opposite side of the rail without breaking the handle.
