In auto repair, dead blow hammers are commonly used for chassis work, dislodging stuck parts and sometimes used for hubcap installation and removal (e.g. knock-off hubs). They can be used to pop out small dents when doing auto body repair. They allow controlled use of impact force when performing engine or transmission repair.
