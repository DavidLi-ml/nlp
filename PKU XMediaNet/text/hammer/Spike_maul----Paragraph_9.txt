Spike mauls are hardened tools. They should not be used to strike other tools as this could cause metal shards to fly. Occasionally the head may become upset or chipped. Heads are often reground on a bench grinder to remove nicks and metal flow. This practice is becoming less common as grinding can hide cracks and other defects. It is also possible to overheat the steel while grinding and remove some of the temper from the tool.
