Steam hammers use steam to drive the hammer. These tended to be the largest models as the great energy of steam was needed to operate them. Locomotive works was one location such large hammers were needed. The workpieces were sometimes so large it required an overhead crane and several men to position the piece in the hammer, and a man to operate the machine.
