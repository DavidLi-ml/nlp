Compared to a conventional hammer of similar weight, a dead blow hammer conveys less peak force, spread over a longer time interval. At the moment the face of the hammer head contacts the surface being struck, the sand or shot within the head is effectively trailing it (being, due to inertia, collected at the opposite end of the head), such that the force imparted by this additional loose weight within the head is not imparted to the struck surface at the moment of contact. Instead, this force is spread out over some period of time, as the sand or shot descends to fill the "face" end of the head. In a conventional solid-head hammer, the force of the entire solid mass of the head is delivered at the moment of impact. Such a blow is obviously less "sharp" than that of the conventional hammer, and feels more "dead" (less rebound) to the user, hence the name.
