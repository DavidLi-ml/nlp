Steam and mechanical power hammers were made into the middle of the 20th century in the United States. At the end of the 19th century the mechanical power hammer became popular in smaller blacksmith and repair shops. These machines were typically rated between 25 and 500 pounds of falling weight. Many may still be seen in use in small manufacturing and artist-blacksmith shops today. In the middle of the 20th century power hammers driven by compressed air began to gain popularity and several manufacturers are currently producing these hammers today.
