The head of a dead blow hammer is commonly hollow and partially filled with loose sand, lead shot, or steel shot, which distribute the energy of the strike over a longer period of time. If a filled hammer head breaks while in use, it is likely to scatter a spray of the loose filler particles in the vicinity. Therefore, use of a traditional dead blow hammer may be restricted in certain settings, such as a manufacturing clean room, where contamination by foreign material could occur.
