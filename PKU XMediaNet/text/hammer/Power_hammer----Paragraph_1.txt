A typical power hammer consists of a frame, an anvil, and a reciprocating ram holding a hammer head or die. The workpiece is placed on the lower anvil or die and the head or upper die strikes the workpiece. The power hammer is a direct descendant of the trip hammer, differing in that the power hammer stores potential energy in an arrangement of mechanical linkages and springs, in compressed air, or steam, and by the fact that it accelerates the ram on the downward stroke. This provides more force than simply allowing the weight to fall. Earlier designs like trip hammer, steam drop hammers, board or strap hammers, use the power source to raise the ram, but let its fall be propelled solely by gravity.
