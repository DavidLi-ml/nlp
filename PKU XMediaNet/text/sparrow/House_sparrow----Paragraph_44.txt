The house sparrow's flight is direct (not undulating) and flapping, averaging 45.5 kilometres per hour (28.3 miles per hour) and about 15 wingbeats per second. On the ground, the house sparrow typically hops rather than walks. It can swim when pressed to do so, by pursuit from predators. Captive birds have been recorded diving and swimming short distances underwater.
