The Cape sparrow was first described by Philipp Ludwig Statius MÃ¼ller in 1776, as Loxia melanura. Some other earlier biologists described the Cape sparrow in Loxia or Fringilla, but it has otherwise been regarded as a member of the genus Passer. Within this genus its relations have generally been regarded as obscure. Mitochondrial DNA studies, however, have strongly suggested that the Cape sparrow among the most basal member (the earliest offshoot) of its genus. It seems to be related to the southern grey-headed sparrow and its relatives, and to the saxaul sparrow of Central Asia.
