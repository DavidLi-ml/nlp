The Cape sparrow was featured on the lowest-denomination South African coin, from the farthing (Â¼-cent) in 1923 to the cent that ceased to be minted in 2002, with designs based on an original by George Kruger Gray. This was said to be because women interned at a concentration camp in Bethulie during the Boer War adopted a biblical quotation (from Matthew 10) as their motto: "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father." Additionally, it has been featured on stamps from Lesotho and the Central African Republic.
