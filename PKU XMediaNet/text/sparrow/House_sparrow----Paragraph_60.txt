The house sparrow's main predators are cats and birds of prey, but many other animals prey on them, including corvids, squirrels, and even humansâ€”the house sparrow has been consumed in the past by people in many parts of the world, and it still is in parts of the Mediterranean. Most species of bird of prey have been recorded preying on the house sparrow in places where there are extensive records. Accipiters and the merlin in particular are major predators, though cats are likely to have a greater impact on house sparrow populations. The house sparrow is also a common victim of roadkill; on European roads, it is the bird most frequently found dead.
