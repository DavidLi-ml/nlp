However, studies of mitochondrial DNA indicate that the russet sparrow is an early offshoot or basal species among the Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows. While mitochrondrial DNA suggest speciation in Passer occurred during the Miocene and Pliocene, British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith considers the russet sparrow to have separated from the other Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the last glacial period. During this time, sparrows would have only been found in isolated ice-free refugia, such as the lower Yangtze valley, which Summers-Smith considers the most likely centre of evolution for the russet sparrow.
