In towns, the Cape sparrow competes with both the native southern grey-headed sparrow and the introduced house sparrow. Since it is more established around humans in its range than either, it successfully competes with both species, though they may exclude it from nesting in holes. There are reports by birdwatchers in suburban areas of South Africa of increases in some regions (the northern Johannesburg area, and Pietermaritzburg) and decreases in others (the southern Cape Town area). The house sparrow is reported decreasing in several urban areas, as it has in parts of Europe, declines which are attributed to factors including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.
