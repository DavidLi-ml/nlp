A hunter must know that being a bird dog owner takes time and effort to have success. As a bird dog owner, he or she will always take the time to make sure their dog has what it takes. However, it is not only the dog that needs to be diligent: the owner must be as well. As Narini Philip portrays in It’s a dog’s life; Opening day, a dog knows his limits and rules that an owner gives. If the dog has set rules as to where it can sleep and what time it eats, then the dog will be a better hunter as will listen to commands such as fetch, stay or retrieve. If a dog does not have exact specific commands it can cause confusion. Also, to avoid damage to the birds, the owner will make sure that the dog knows how “point dead,” as Jerome B. Robinson says, otherwise the bird will come back damaged.
