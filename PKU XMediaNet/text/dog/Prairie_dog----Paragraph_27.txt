The European Union did not take action on the ban to import from the U.S. animals captured in the wild, which remains valid. Major European Prairie Dog Associations, such as AICDP, remain against import from the United States, due to the high death rate of wild captures  Several zoos in Europe have stable prairie dog colonies that generate enough supernumerary pups to saturate the EU internal demand, and several associations help owners to give adoption to captivity-born animals.
