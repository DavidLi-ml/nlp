In May 1921, the government minister Rıza Nur ordered the commander of the Eastern Front, Kazım Karabekir, for the monuments of Ani to "be wiped off the face of the earth." Karabekir records in his memoirs that he has vigorously rejected this command and it has never been carried out, but the wiping-out of all traces of Marr's excavations and building repairs suggests that the command was partially carried out.
