Very few studies have investigated the breeding habits of the cuckoo roller. It has been described in the past as a polygamous breeder, but no evidence for this is available. The nest is located in tall trees, 4–6 m (13–20 ft) off the ground, in natural cavities. No lining is placed inside the cavity; the white eggs are laid directly on the bottom. The usual clutch size is around four eggs. Incubation is performed by the female only, while the male feeds her. The incubation period is about 20 days, after which fluffy chicks are born. Chicks remain in the nest for 30 days before fledging.
