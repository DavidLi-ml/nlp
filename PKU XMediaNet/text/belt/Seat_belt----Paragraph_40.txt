Helping to improve safety apparatuses in vehicles, injury testing, and seat belt effectiveness are being tested today by Wayne State University’s Automotive Safety Research Group, as well as other researchers. Wayne State’s Bioengineering Center uses human cadavers in their crash test research. Albert King, the Center’s director, wrote in his 1995 article titled "Humanitarian Benefits of Cadaver Research on Injury Prevention” that that use of cadavers in this type of research since 1987 has saved and will continue to save nearly 8,500 lives each year, due to the vehicle safety improvements made possible by human cadaver testing. He also indicates that due to the improvements made to three-point safety belts an average of 61 lives are saved per year.
