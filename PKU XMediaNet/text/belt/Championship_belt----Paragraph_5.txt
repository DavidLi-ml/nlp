Typically, pro wrestling title belts have a unique design for each title, in contrast with boxing and mixed martial arts where the title belts of a given sanctioning body are all the same design. The Big Gold Belt design, for example, is very recognizable and has been used by various wrestling promotions since the 1980s.
