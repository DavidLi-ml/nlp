A studded belt is typically made of leather or similar materials, and is decorated with metal studs. Studded belts are often a part of punk/emo scene, skater, Goth and metal fashion, but are more common for teenage girls, usually worn with jeans and high heels, or knee-high heeled leather boots tucked into jeans.
