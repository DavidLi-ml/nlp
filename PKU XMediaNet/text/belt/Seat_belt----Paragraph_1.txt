An analysis conducted in the United States in 1984 compared a variety of seat belt types alone and in combination with air bags. The range of fatality reduction for front seat passengers was broad, from 20% to 55%, as was the range of major injury, from 25% to 60%. More recently, the CDC has summarized this data by stating "seat belts reduce serious crash-related injuries and deaths by about half."
