Steel belts play an essential role in modern, continuous production processes for wood based panels (WBP) such as particle boards, OSB- and MDF boards, where they serve as heat and pressure transfer media at the same time. As the steel belt surface has a direct influence on the final panel surface quality, this application imposes high demands on steel belts regarding thickness uniformity and surface finish.
