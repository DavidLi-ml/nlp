Steel belts are available in a range of sizes ranging typically from 400 mm wide x 0.6 mm thick to around 3,000 mm wide x 3.0 mm thick. There are special applications that may use belts of narrower and thinner or wider and thicker size, but these are not common. The length of the belts are typically in the range 10 m to 100 m long, however it is theoretically possible to produce a belt of unlimited length by joining of shorter belts sections.
