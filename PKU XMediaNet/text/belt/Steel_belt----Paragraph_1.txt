They are generally made from carbon Steel or stainless steel. Stainless steel belts are corrosion resistant and provide excellent surface quality. Stainless steel belts are used primarily in the chemical, food, rubber, plastic, wood, and laminate industries. Carbon steel belts are energy efficient and ideal for applications necessitating radiant heating of products or in high temperature applications that might exceed the annealing temperatures of stainless steel belts also carbon steel belts can more evenly distributed heat since most stainless steel alloys are comparatively poor heat conductors. Carbon steel belts are used primarily in food processing, transport and bake ovens.
