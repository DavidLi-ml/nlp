In this sector, continuous stainless steel belts are an integral part of continuous production processes. Unlike conveyor belts used purely for transportation purposes, steel belts used in this industry serve as media for transferring heat and/or pressure. Applications for steel belts in the chemical industry include casting, polymerizing of resins, waxes, para fins and many other substances.
