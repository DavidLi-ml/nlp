Steel belts helps to move the finished product or raw material. Steel Belt also help in parcel sorting systems, transporting of bottles, bulk loads, bricks, machinery parts and the like. Straight tracking, high abrasion resistance and dynamic fatigue strength are crucial when transporting bulky material or unit load. Extremely high operating speeds cause a high number of load cycles and create severe operating conditions. Steel belts are made to match these extreme requirements.
