When an endless belt does not fit the need, jointed and link V-belts may be employed. Most models offer the same power and speed ratings as equivalently-sized endless belts and do not require special pulleys to operate. A link v-belt is a number of polyurethane/polyester composite links held together, either by themselves, such as Fenner Drives' PowerTwist, or by metal studs, such as Gates' Nu-T-Link. These provide easy installation and superior environmental resistance compared to rubber belts and are length adjustable by disassembling and removing links when needed.
