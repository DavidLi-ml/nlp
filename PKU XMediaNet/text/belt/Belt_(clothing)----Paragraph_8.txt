A common sight in fantasy and role playing characters is the excessive use of belts in all different sizes on the character's person. Usually they are used for securing clothing or armor, but others just have several belts around the arms, legs, neck, waist, hips, and across the breasts for decoration. Sometimes they are used in place of eye patches or to decorate weapons. This was also common in superhero costume design of the early 1990s.
