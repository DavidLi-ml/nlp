Despite their common English name implying an Indian origin, the so-called Indian clubs were in fact created in the Near East. Properly referred to as meels (Persian: میل mil), they are first recorded as being used by wrestlers in ancient Persia, Egypt and the rest of the Middle East. The practice has continued to the present day, notably in the varzesh-e bastani tradition practiced in the zurkaneh of Iran. From Persia, the Mughals brought meels to South Asia where they are still used by pehlwan (wrestlers) in South Asia today. British colonists first came across meels in India, and erroneously referred to them as "Indian clubs" despite their Middle Eastern origin.
