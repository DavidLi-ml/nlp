Shillelagh â€“ A shillelagh is a wooden club or cudgel, typically made from a stout knotty stick with a large knob on the end, that is associated with Ireland in folklore. The origin of the weapon is classically a side branch of a small blackthorne tree, cut as a walking stick with a section of the trunk at the top: the angled hammer-head shape is then worn down in use.
