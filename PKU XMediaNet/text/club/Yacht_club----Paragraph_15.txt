The traditions and prestige normally associated with yacht clubs have to some extent been subverted or appropriated unofficially by groups and businesses calling themselves "yacht clubs". For example, the "Gowanus Yacht Club" is a beer garden in Brooklyn, NY, the "Crystal Bay Yacht Club" is a beach resort in Ko Samui, Thailand and "The Eagle Rock Yacht Club" is a non-profit dodgeball league in Glassell Park, Los Angeles. These so-called "yacht clubs" don't necessarily involve sailing on the private yachts of their members as their main purpose or activity, but often outwardly maintain a nautical or water-oriented theme.
