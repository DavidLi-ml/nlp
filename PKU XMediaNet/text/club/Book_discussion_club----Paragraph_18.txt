BookSurfing is a social network based book discussion club that uses Facebook as its platform to organize and set up meetings. A moderator sets up a Facebook event and selects eight people who meet at one of the participants house for a "Surf". Every participant reads the text he brings out loud to the entire group. The participants may use any readable text but it must not exceed 450 words. In every "Surf", at least one of the participants must be new to BookSurfing. Among the participants there should always be some people who don't know each other and every surf must have a moderator. The texts and reasons for choosing them are then discussed. Booksurfing was founded in Tel Aviv Israel in 2013 by Raz Spector and now has groups in various countries.
