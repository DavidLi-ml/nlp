Finally, there are rowing clubs which are not physical entities at all. For example, many high schools and universities maintain an alumni rowing club. Members of these clubs typically train on their own and meet up with their fellow club members to race. The club status must be maintained in order to participate in events sanctioned by USRowing or other governing bodies.
