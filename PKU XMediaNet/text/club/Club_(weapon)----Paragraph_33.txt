Telescopic â€“ Telescopic batons are rigid batons that are capable of collapsing to a shorter length for greater portability and concealability. They are illegal in the United Kingdom and some other countries. In Hungary these weapons are named vipera ("viper") and though officially illegal, they were reported as being repeatedly used by riot police units.
