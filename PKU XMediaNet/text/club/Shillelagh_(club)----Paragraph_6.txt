Shillelaghs are sometimes referred to in a similar context in folk songs, such as in the ballad "Finnegan's Wake," in which the term "shillelagh law" refers to a brawl, and in the 19th century song "Rocky Road to Dublin," in which references are made to fashioning a shillelagh, using it to hold a tied bag over one's shoulder, and using it as a striking weapon.
