A rowing club is a club for people interested in the sport of Rowing. Rowing clubs are usually near a body of water, whether natural or artificial, that is large enough for manoeuvering the shells (rowing boats). Clubs usually have a boat house with racks to store boats, and a dock or slipway to get them into the water. Many clubs host rowing competitions, known as regattas, on a certain weekend every year, and send a competitive team to other regattas.
