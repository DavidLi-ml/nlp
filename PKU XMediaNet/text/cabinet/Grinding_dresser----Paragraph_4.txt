Star dressers â€” A long handled tool with a row of free running, hardened and serrated, discs running at right angles to the handle. These are presented to the grinding wheel as it is turned off and slows down. Force is applied to the face of the slowing wheel with the result that the hardened discs match speed with the face of the wheel allowing the fingers or undulating surface of the dresser, to knock the abrasive grains out.
