An alternate etymological theory, also unsubstantiated, derives from the distinctive accent local to Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts. Similar to the more famous Boston accent, this accent tends to drop r. For instance, "car" is pronounced "cah" in both Boston and Rhode Island. "Carbonate" (soda water) may be pronounced more like "cabinet", suggesting that a "cabinet" beverage may have originally referred to an ice cream float.
