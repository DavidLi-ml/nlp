In recent years, it has become more difficult to find an authentic cabinet, but many Rhode Island creameries still serve them, including Delekta's Pharmacy in Warren, and the Original Vanilla Bean in South Kingstown. Newport Creamery, a chain of family restaurants found almost exclusively in Rhode Island, serves a variation of cabinets made with ice milk under the brand name "Awful Awful". A cabinet is often referred to elsewhere in New England as a frappe.
