Many baseball players give a teammate who has just hit a walk-off home run, or a pitcher who has thrown a no-hitter, a Gatorade shower while they are giving a post-game interview on the field. Salvador PÃ©rez of the Kansas City Royals is known for giving a Gatorade shower to teammates after every home win and notable away wins, or a pitcher who has thrown a no-hitter.
