Communal showers are a group of single showers put together in one room or area. They are often used in changerooms, prisons, and army barracks for personal hygiene. Though not as prevalent in the West today, communal showers are often present in school locker rooms for use in personal hygiene after physical education. They also continue to exist in some gymnasia and many swimming pools. The practice of communal showers is not without controversy.
