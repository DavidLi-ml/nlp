The World Health Organization recommends hand washing with ash if soap is not available in emergencies, schools without access to soap  and other difficult situations like post-emergencies where use of (clean) sand is recommended too. Use of ash is common and has in experiments been shown at least as effective as soap for removing bacteria.
