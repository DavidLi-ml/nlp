A field shower is equipment used to provide sanitation and decontamination facilities to military personnel, equipment and vehicles using various liquids, including water in the field of operations. Usually the showering facility is provided by the combat service support elements or decontamination units to combat units deployed away from permanent properties that offer the facilities, or when combat units have been exposed to hazardous chemicals and need to quickly decontaminate themselves.
