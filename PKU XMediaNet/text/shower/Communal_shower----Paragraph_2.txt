In continental Europe, students tend to shower communally in sex-segregated changerooms after physical education classes. Fathers taking their young daughters or mothers taking their young sons into the gender-segregated changing rooms is mostly viewed as non-controversial, although some public baths have introduced family changing rooms. Some private gymnasiums have instituted rules specifically prohibiting family members of opposite genders taking their children into single-sex locker rooms. In public saunas in north west part of continental Europe, it is very common to see mixed changerooms and showers.
