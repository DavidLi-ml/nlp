A navy shower (also known as a "combat shower", "military shower", "sea shower", "staggered shower", or "G.I. bath") is a method of showering that allows for significant conservation of water and energy by turning off the flow of water in the middle portion of the shower while lathering. Soldiers are sometimes trained to keep the total time of the water flow to under two minutes â€“ using an initial thirty seconds or so to get wet, followed by shutting off the water, using soap and lathering, then rinsing for a minute or less.
