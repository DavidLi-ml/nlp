Over longer periods of time, the dust trails can evolve in complicated ways. For example, the orbits of some repeating comets, and meteoroids leaving them, are in resonant orbits with Jupiter or one of the other large planets â€“ so many revolutions of one will equal another number of revolutions of the other. This creates a shower component called a filament.
