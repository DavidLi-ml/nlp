In the United States Army, the responsibility for deploying field showers lies with the quartermasters. The field shower is also found in the U.S. Army's overseas deployments; for example, a field shower fed by two 2000-litre water bivets was set up in Ramadi, Iraq by the members of the 89th Regimental Chemical Shop.
