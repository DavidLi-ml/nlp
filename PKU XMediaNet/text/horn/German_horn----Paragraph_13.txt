The double horn essentially combines two instruments into a single frame: one horn in F, and a second, higher horn keyed in B♭. Like the single horn it has three valves, but each has a double set of tubing, the first tuned in F and a shorter set in B♭. By depressing a fourth valve (usually operated by the thumb), the horn player can quickly switch from the deep, warm tones of the F horn to the higher, brighter tones of the B♭ horn. The two sets of tones are commonly called "sides" of the horn. Using the fourth valve not only changes the basic length (and thus the harmonic series and pitch) of the instrument, it also causes the three main valves to use proportionate slide lengths. Other double-horn combinations have also been made, for example with the F side above the B♭ side, an octave higher than the usual F horn, and "double B♭" and "double F" horns, each with the two sides an octave apart.
