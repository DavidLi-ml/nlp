In agriculture, and dry material handling generally, sound horns are often used to start material flow or to force release of impacted materials. In a grain silo, such a horn may be mounted inside the silo and sounded as the silo is emptied to loosen stuck granules. Typically, these use any fundamental frequency from around 120-250Hz, and are about 120dB SPL, and are powered by compressed air. They are sometimes called acoustic cleaners or acoustic horns.
