The French horn (when the name is used specifically for a horn type) in modern use is a narrow-bore horn (10.8 to 11 mm) with three PÃ©rinet (piston) valves. It retains the narrow bell-throat and mouthpipe crooks of the orchestral hand horn of the late eighteenth century, and most often has an "ascending" third valve. This is a whole-tone valve arranged so that with the valve in the "up" position the valve loop is engaged, but when the valve is pressed the loop is cut out, raising the pitch by a whole tone. Some early examples had only two valves, and on others the valve section, called the sauterelle could be removed and replaced by a simple main tuning slide and coupling tubes, allowing the instrument to be played as a natural horn.
