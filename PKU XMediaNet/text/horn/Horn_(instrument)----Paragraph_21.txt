The French horn, like the German and Vienna horns, is usually referred to simply as the "horn". The bore of the French horn is small, between 10.8 and 11 mm, compared to 11.5 mm for the German horn, but not as small as the Vienna horn at 10.7 mm. A musician who plays the French horn, like the players of the German and Vienna horns, is called a horn player (or less frequently, a hornist). French horns have piston valves (similar to a trumpet's).
