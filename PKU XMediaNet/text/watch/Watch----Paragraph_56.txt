Wristwatches with analog displays generally have a small knob, called the crown, that can be used to adjust the time and, in mechanical watches, wind the spring. Almost always, the crown is located on the right-hand side of the watch. This makes it inconvenient to use if the watch is being worn on the right wrist. Usually, therefore, watches are worn on the left wrist, even if the wearer is left-handed.
