The concept of the wristwatch goes back to the production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch from Robert Dudley in 1571, described as an arm watch. The oldest surviving Wristwatch (then described as a bracelet watch) is one made in 1806 and given to Jos√©phine de Beauharnais. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century.
