Watch winders are available to store automatic watches and keep them wound for people who do not wear their automatic watches every day. This is particularly advantageous where a watch has complications, such as perpetual calendars or moon phases. A watch winder can hold one or more watches and move them in circular patterns or oscillating patterns to approximate the human movement which keeps the watch wound. This movement is what keeps the self-winding mechanism working when it is worn. A special variation of a watch winder is also available to keep non-automatic (hand wound) watches wound by rotating the watch crown periodically. Older mechanical watches should be wound and running as much as possible to prevent their lubricants from congealing over time, diminishing accuracy. Modern mechanical watches generally use synthetic oil; whether or not synthetic oils congeal is a point of contention among watch experts. A full service (which involves disassembly, cleaning and re-lubrication) should be performed at least every five years to keep the watch as accurate as possible.
