In 2010, Miyota (Citizen Watch) of Japan introduced a newly developed movement that uses 3 prongs quartz crystal that exclusively produce for Bulova to be used in the Precisionist or Accutron II line, a new type of quartz watch with ultra-high frequency (262.144 kHz) which is claimed to be accurate to +/- 10 seconds a year and has a smooth sweeping second hand rather than one that jumps each second.
