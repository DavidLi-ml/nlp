An analog watch has hands to show the time. One for the hours is short and thick. One for the minutes is long and thick. And sometimes one for the seconds which is long and thin, this is clearly the second hand because it goes round so fast. Analog watches for adults don't always have any numbers on. They are supposed to know the order of the numbers already. Often the 12 o'clock position is marked.
