In Korea, the dish goes by the name juk 죽 (IPA: [tɕuk]), a word derived from Chinese. More than 40 varieties of juk are mentioned in old documents. Depending on the ingredients and consistency, juk can be considered as a food for recuperation (much like chicken soup in modern American culture), a delicacy, or famine food.
