Israeli photographer and video artist Michal Rovner uses Petri dishes in many of her exhibitions to project miniature images of groups of humans performing movements and dance. Antoine Bridier-Nahmias deliberately grows mold in Petri dishes which often grows symmetrically and with somewhat attractive colors. His photos are on the blog "Magical Contamination."
