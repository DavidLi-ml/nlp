In Turkish cuisine, wheat-based mixed dessert congee is called as Ashure. It is a little similar with eight ingredient Chinese congee. It mostly uses seven, ten or twelve ingredients. The ingredients can vary spontaneously but it must be vegan (no animal-based ingredients) like nuts, fruits, grains and sugar. Twelve ingredients represent Alevi behavings called as Twelver. Alevi communities cook it at the tenth day of Muharrem which is the first month of the Ä°slamic calendar. It is a common dessert in Turkey, Greece and Albania.
