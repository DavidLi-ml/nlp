Kayu (粥), or often Okayu (お粥) is the name for the type of congee eaten in Japan, which is less broken down than congee produced in other cultures. For example, a Cantonese jūk typically uses a water-to-rice ratio of 12:1, but kayu typically uses ratios of 5:1 or 7:1. Also, its cooking time is shorter than other types of congee: kayu is cooked for about 30 minutes, while Cantonese jūk cook for an hour or more.
