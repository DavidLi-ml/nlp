In Japan, congee is popularly known as a food served to the ill. Because it is soft and easily digestible, okayu is commonly the first solid food served to Japanese infants; it is used to help with the transition from liquids to normally cooked "plain" rice, as it is a major part of the Japanese diet. It is also commonly eaten by the elderly for the same reasons.
