In Burma (now called Myanmar), rice congee is called ဆန်ပြုတ် hsan byok [sʰàmbjoʊʔ], literally "boiled rice". It is very thin and plain, often made with just rice and water, but sometimes with chicken or pork stock and served with a simple garnish of chopped spring onions and crispy fried onions. As in other Asian countries, rice congee is considered food for the unwell.
