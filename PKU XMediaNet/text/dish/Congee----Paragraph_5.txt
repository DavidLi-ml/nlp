Chinese congees (Chinese: 粥; pinyin: zhōu, Jyutping zuk1), or in Cantonese jūk, vary considerably by region. For example, to make Cantonese congee, white rice is boiled in many times its weight of water for a long time until the rice breaks down and becomes a fairly thick, white porridge (Pinyin: báizhōu). Congees made in other regions may use different types of rice with different quantities of water, producing congees of different consistencies.
