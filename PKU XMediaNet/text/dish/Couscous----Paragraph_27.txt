In Israel there is a dish similar to maftoul (by look, not taste) called ptitim, which has many variations and can appear as a mini triangles, or looking like rice (the original type, sometimes called 'Ben Gurion rice') and many other variations. The most famous variation of ptitim looks like couscous and as Americans started to call it "Israeli couscous", the Osem company started to produce it outside Israel under this name. Ptitim is not the same as mograbia (a.k.a. maftoul, pearl couscous etc.), though the two can be used similarly. Mograbia is a coated couscous; ptitim is an extruded paste. The word "maftoul" is sometimes incorrectly used in America to refer to Israeli couscous.
