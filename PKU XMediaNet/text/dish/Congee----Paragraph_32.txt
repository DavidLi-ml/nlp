The most general form of juk is simply called huin juk (흰죽, white juk), which is made from plain white rice. Other varieties include different ingredients, such as vegetables, seafood, nuts and other grains. Being largely unflavored, it is served with a number of more flavorful side dishes, such as jeotgal, various types of kimchi, pickled cuttlefish, spicy octopus, and others.
