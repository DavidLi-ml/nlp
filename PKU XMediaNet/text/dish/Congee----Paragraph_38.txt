Arroz caldo is usually spiced with safflower and black pepper in place of or in addition to the more traditional ginger and scallion. Arroz caldo is more popular among Ilocano, Hiligaynon, and Cebuano peoples (who locally called it as pospas), although those of other provinces, such as Cebu and Bohol, often eat it with the addition of prawns, olive oil, bay leaf, and Chinese sausage.
