Plain rice congee, known as khao tom kui (Thai: ข้าวต้มกุ๊ย), is often eaten at specialized restaurants which serve a multitude of side dishes to go with it, such as yam kun chiang (a Thai salad made with sliced dried Chinese sausages), mu phalo (pork stewed in soy sauce and five-spice powder), and mu nam liap (minced pork fried with chopped Chinese olives).
