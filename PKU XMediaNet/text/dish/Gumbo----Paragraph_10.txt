Cajun gumbo is usually identified by its dark roux, cooked until it is a color "a few shades from burning". The roux is used with okra or fil√© powder. Seafood is popular in Cajun gumbo, but the southwestern areas of Louisiana often use fowl, such as chicken or duck, and sausage. The fowl is generally not deboned, and onions, celery, and bell pepper are not strained out of the dish. Cajun gumbo is usually topped with parsley and green onions.
