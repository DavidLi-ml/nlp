The behaviour of domestic pigs resembles that of dogs and humans more than that of cattle or sheep. In many ways, their behaviour appears to be intermediate between that of carnivores and the more highly evolved artiodactyls. Domestic pigs seek out the company of other pigs, and often huddle to maintain physical contact, although they do not naturally form large herds.
