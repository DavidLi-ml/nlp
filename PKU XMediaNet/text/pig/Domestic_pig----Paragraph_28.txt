Pigs are exhibited at agricultural shows, judged either as stud stock compared to the standard features of each breed, or in commercial classes where the animals are judged primarily on their suitability for slaughter to provide premium meat. According to The Livestock Conservancy, seven breeds of swine in the US are critically rare (having a global population of fewer than 2000), as are the Auckland Island Pig (New Zealand) and woolly-coated grazing pig (Danube area).
