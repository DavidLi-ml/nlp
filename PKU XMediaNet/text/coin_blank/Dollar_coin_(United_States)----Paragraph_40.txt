From 1971 through 1976 the Mint also produced dollars composed of 40% silver aimed at the collector market. The 1971â€“74 issues appeared in brown boxes or blue packages, depending on whether they were proof or uncirculated. Somewhat different Bicentennial sets were produced in the following two years. All issues remain very common.
