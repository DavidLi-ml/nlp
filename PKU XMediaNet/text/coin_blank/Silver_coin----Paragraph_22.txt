With the reduced or even non-existent link between the value of the currency and the value of precious metals since the Great Depression of the 1930s, silver gradually ceased to be used in the manufacture of ordinary circulating coins. For this reason, silver coins are mainly either special commemorative coins minted for sale to coin collectors or bullion coins primarily sold to investors that, although legal tender, are not expected to circulate. Anything pre1964 in dimes and quarters are 90% silver. Nickels from 1943-1945 are 35% silver along with some 1942.
