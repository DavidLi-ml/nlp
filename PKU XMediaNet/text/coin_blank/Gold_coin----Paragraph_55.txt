An old practice to test whether a gold coin was counterfeit was to bite down on it. Since pure gold is relatively soft any base metals mixed with the gold to lessen its value will also harden the coin, and so make it harder to bite on. Another explanation of this practice is that historic gold coins were usually alloyed with silver and copper which make them harder than pure gold and less prone to wear. Counterfeits could be made of lead to approximate the weight of gold and covered with a thin layer of real gold. Biting the coin would mark the softer lead or scratch through the veneer revealing the base metal underneath.
