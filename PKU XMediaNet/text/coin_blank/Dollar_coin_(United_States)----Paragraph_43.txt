The Anthony dollar, because of its color, size and design, was often confused with the quarter and was never popular. It was soon discontinued. In 1999 it made a brief reappearance when Treasury reserves were low and the Sacagawea dollar was still a year away from production. While reserves of the coins were high, the coins were most often seen in vending machines, transit systems and post offices.
