The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) has stated that discontinuing the dollar bill in favor of the dollar coin would save the U.S. government approximately $5.5 billion over thirty years primarily through seigniorage. However, the GAO's $5.5 billion estimate is controversial, having been attacked as misrepresentation in a lawsuit alleging that the correct sum is in excess of $58 billion. The dollar coin is so unpopular with the Federal Reserve that it has contrived barriers to its distribution, according to the testimony of ex-Mint director Philip Diehl in November 2012.
