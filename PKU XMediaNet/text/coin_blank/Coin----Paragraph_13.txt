Another candidate for the site of the earliest coins is Aegina, where Chelone ("turtle") coins were first minted on 700 BCE, either by the local Aegina people or by Pheidon king of Argos (who first set the standards of weights and measures). In the Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris, there is a unique electrum stater of Aegina.
