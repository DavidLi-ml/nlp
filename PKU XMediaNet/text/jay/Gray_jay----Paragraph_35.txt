Gray jays are consumed by several bird species including great gray owls (Strix nebulosa), northern hawk-owls (Surnia ulula), and Mexican spotted owls (Strix occidentalis lucida). Gray jay remains were found in the nest sites of fisher (Martes pennanti) and American marten (Martes americana). Red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) eat gray jay eggs.
