Gray jays commonly prey on nestling birds. Nests are located visually by moving from perch to perch and scanning surroundings. Gray jay predation on nestling birds is temporally homogeneous throughout the passerine breeding season. Avian nest predation by gray jays is not necessarily higher in fragmented versus unfragmented forest.
