Gray jay young are altricial. Nestling growth is most rapid from the fourth through the tenth day following hatching. Young are fed food carried in the throats of both parents. They are fed by the accompanying nonbreeding third bird ("stayer") only during the postfledgling period. Food is a dark brown, viscous paste containing primarily arthropods. Young gray jays leave the nest between 22 and 24 days after hatching. Juveniles reach full adult measurements within 5 months. Natal dispersal distance for the gray jay is a median of 0.0 mile for males, 1.7 miles (2.8 km) for females, and a maximum distance of 7.0 miles (11.3 km) for males and females.
