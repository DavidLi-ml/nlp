Caching is inhibited by the presence of Steller's jays and gray jays from adjacent territories, which follow resident gray jays to steal cached food. Gray jays carry large food items to distant cache sites for storage more often than small food items. To prevent theft, they also tend to carry valuable food items further from the source when caching in the company of one or more gray jays. Scatterhoarding discourages pilferage by competitors. Cache thievery increases with increased cache density.
