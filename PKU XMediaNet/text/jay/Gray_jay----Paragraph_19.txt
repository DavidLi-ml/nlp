Gray jays are omnivorous. Foods eaten include arthropods, small mammals, nestling birds, carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), and seeds. Two gray jays were seen eating slime mold (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This was the first report of any bird consuming slime mold in the field.
