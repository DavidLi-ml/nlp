The bushy-crested jay seems to be an adaptable species and is coping with the degradation of its natural environment by moving in to manmade habitats such as coffee plantations and cropland. It has a wide range and the population is thought to be increasing, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as a species of least concern.
