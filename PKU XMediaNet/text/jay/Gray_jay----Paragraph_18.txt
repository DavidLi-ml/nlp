In studies conducted in Ontario and Quebec, the mortality rate for nonbreeding dominant juveniles ("stayers") was 52%, and mortality was 85% for nonbreeding "leavers" between fledging in June to approximately mid-October. From fall to the following breeding season in March, further nonbreeder mortality was 50%. Territory-holding adult gray jays experienced low mortality rates (15.1% and 18.2% for males and females, respectively). The oldest known female gray jay was 16 years old, and one male was at least 14 years old. Food-storing birds such as the gray jay may live longer than other species due to the increased probability of food availability.
