John Fiske described the wearing of distressed or ripped jeans as an example of his excorporation concept, which "is the process by which the subordinate make their own culture out of the resources and commodities provided by the dominant system". When wearing ripped jeans or other products beyond their replacement date, one reduces the number of jeans purchased and thereby participation in capitalism.
