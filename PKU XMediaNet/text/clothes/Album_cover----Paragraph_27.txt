Some album covers have been banned due to violence, nudity and other banned pictures. Guns N' Roses's 1987 album Appetite for Destruction's cover depicted a robot rapist about to be punished by a metal avenger. Kanye West's 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy depicted West naked being straddled by a phoenix with her bare breasts and bare buttocks showing.
