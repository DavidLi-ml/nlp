Since the mid-1990s, the compact disc (CD) has become the most common form of physically-distributed music products. Packaging formats vary, including the very common plastic jewel-case, and the cardboard and plastic combination commonly known as a Digipak. Typically the album cover component of these packages is approximately 4.75 in (12.1 cm) square.
