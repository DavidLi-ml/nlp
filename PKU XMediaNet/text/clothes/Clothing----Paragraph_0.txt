Clothing (also called clothes) is manufactured fiber and textile material worn on the body. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to humans and is a feature of nearly all human society. The amount and type of clothing one wears depend on physical requirements and local culture. Cultures regard some clothing types as gender-specific.
