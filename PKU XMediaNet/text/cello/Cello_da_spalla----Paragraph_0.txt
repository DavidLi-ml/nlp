The cello da spalla or violoncello da spalla is a small cello played braced against the shoulder. The instrument was used by some composers, including J. S. Bach. The five-string version may have been what Bach had in mind for performing his Cello Suite No. 6. The violoncello da spalla was designed to be played by violinists, who have limited experience playing instruments such as the viola da gamba or cello, which are held in a vertical position fixed between legs. The viola de spalla is held on the shoulder and chest, and is larger than the viola.
