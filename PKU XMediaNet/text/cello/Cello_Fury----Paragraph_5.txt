Besides performing, Cello Fury actively participates in outreach events and programs targeted toward young musicians. They are on the roster for the "Gateway to the Arts", a non-profit program that sponsors musicians to educate students in the arts. For example, in 2010, "Gateway to the Arts" organized a school performance featuring Cello Fury at Pittsburgh's Cornell Elementary. In addition, the band performs outreach concerts for "Class Acts Arts" in Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C and for "Young Audiences of Rochester" in upstate New York. In addition to their contribution to "Gateway to the Arts", Cello Fury founded an annual strings rock camp and taught at "Summers Dreamers" camp held at numerous Pittsburgh public schools during the summer months.
