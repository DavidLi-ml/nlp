The second Bourrée, though in C minor, has a 2-flat (or G minor) key-signature. This notation, common in pre-Classical music, is sometimes known as a partial key-signature. The first and second Bourrée of the third suite is sometimes used as solo material for other bass instruments such as the tuba, euphonium, trombone and bassoon.
