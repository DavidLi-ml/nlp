Nicole Myers, Simon Cummings and Ben Muñoz met as music students at Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 2004, the ensemble emerged with four cellists, known as Cellofourte. Three of the cellists, Myers, Cummings and Muñoz persevered with the ensemble. They established themselves as Cello Fury in October 2009, launching several successes, and added a rock drummer to the group.
