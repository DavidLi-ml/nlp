Just before the appearance of C. dirus, North America was invaded by the genus Xenocyon (ancestor of the Asian dhole and the African hunting dog) that was as large as C. dirus and more hypercarnivorous. The fossil record shows them as rare and it is assumed that they could not compete with the newly derived C. dirus. Stable isotope analysis indicates that Canis dirus, the saber-toothed cat Smilodon fatalis, and the extinct American lion Panthera atrox competed for the same prey. Other large carnivores present at that time include the extinct North American giant shortfaced bear Arctodus simus, the extant cougar Puma concolor, the Pleistocene coyote Canis latrans, and the gray wolf Canis lupus. These predators may have competed with humans who hunted for similar prey. Specimens that have been identified by morphology to be Beringian wolves (lupus) and radiocarbon dated between 25,800-14,300 YBP have been recently found in the Natural Trap Cave at the base of the Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming, United States. The location is directly south of what would at that time have been the division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. A temporary channel between the glaciers may have existed that allowed these large, Alaskan megafaunally-adapted direct competitors of the dire wolf to come south of the ice sheets. Dire wolves were absent north of 42Â°N latitude in the Late Pleistocene, therefore this region would have been available for Beringian wolves to expand south along the glacier line. How widely they were then distributed is unknown. These also became extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene as did the dire wolf.
