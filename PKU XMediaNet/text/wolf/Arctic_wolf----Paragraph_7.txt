The Arctic wolf population was exterminated from eastern Greenland during the 1930s by European commercial hunters. They were considered absent for over 40 years. A wolf pair had arrived into a historical wolf range followed by several other wolves over the next four years. This move led to a successful invasion of this area. The evidence suggests that the invading Arctic wolves arrived into east Greenland by unintentional human mediated jump dispersal. Arctic wolves failed to establish a living population in east Greenland for over 40 years due to: a low propagule pressure, invasions were high risk, and only singletons made it into eastern Greenland.
