Canis lupus was recorded by Carl Linnaeus in his publication Systema Naturae in 1758. The Latin classification translates into English as "dog wolf". The subspecies of Canis lupus are listed in Mammal Species of the World. The nominate subspecies is the Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), also known as the common wolf. As of 2005 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by MSW3, however the classification of several as either species or subspecies has recently been challenged.
