The decline and extermination of the Arctic wolf population was studied in east Greenland between 1899 and 1939. Through these years, there were 252 sightings of the wolves and/or their tracks. Of 112 wolves that were sighted in the early winter, 31.3% were lone wolves, 23.2% were in pairs, and the rest stayed together in larger groups. The average pack size of the Arctic wolves was 3.3, packs of four or more were rare. The Arctic wolf population was mainly in the central part of the range, which made them vulnerable to the Danish and Norwegian hunters, which exterminated the population with the use of poison. They are endangered due to their exceptionally low densities, smaller pack sizes, infrequent reproduction, and lower offspring production. The population was not harvested by the Europeans prior to 1899. There was no effort to bring back or grow the population because the main goal was to maximize profits by killing as many Arctic foxes as possible. Arctic wolves were considered less in terms of economic significance because of their low abundance. They were mainly killed and exterminated due to interfering with commercial hunting by destroying foxes in traps. Between 1920 and 1932, 35 wolves were killed in the core wolf range, forcing the population to decline rapidly. The Arctic wolf population in five of the six core range areas of east Greenland has severely collapsed and declined rapidly after the arrival of European commercial hunters. There is no other evidence for the potential decline in the Arctic wolf population.
