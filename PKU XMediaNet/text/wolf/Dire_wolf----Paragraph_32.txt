The American megafaunal extinction event occurred 12,700 YBP when 90 genera of mammals weighing over 44 kilograms became extinct. The dire wolf is inferred to have become extinct near the end of the Pleistocene in both North and South America. The extinction of the large carnivores and scavengers is thought to be caused by the extinction of their megaherbivore prey. However, a study of the dental microwear on tooth enamel was undertaken for specimens of all of the carnivore species from Rancho La Brea, California, including dirus. The evidence suggests that these carnivores were not food-stressed just before extinction and that carcass utilization was less than among large carnivores today. Its extinction has been proposed to be based on its reliance on megaherbivores, the impact of climate change, and competition with other species including humans but the cause is not known.
