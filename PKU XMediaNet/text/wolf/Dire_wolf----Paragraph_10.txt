In South America, Late Pleistocene dirus remains have been found along the north and west coasts but nowhere else. Its remains have not been found in Argentina that produced Canis gezi and Canis nehringi. Some researchers have proposed that dirus may have originated in South America. In 1988, a study formally described these two large South American wolves, with C. gezi found in Ensenadan era deposits that relate to the North American late Blancan and Irvingtonian, and C. nehringi found in Lujanian deposits that relate to the Late Pleistocene. Given their morphological similarities and timeframes, it was proposed that C. gezi was the ancestor of C. nehringi. The study indicated that C. gezi was most similar to the late Irvingtonian Aenocyon dirus nebrascensis and was its sister taxa, but C. nehringi had a closer relationship to Rancholabrean dirus. The study found that dirus was the most evolutionary derived genus Canis species in the New World, and compared to C. nehringi was larger in size and construction of its lower molars for more efficient predation. In 2009, a proposal was made that because there was believed to be a link between Canis armbrusteri and the Rancholabrean dirus, that a case could also be argued for a collateral South American lineage linking C. gezi with C. nehringi. These two clades share dental and cranial similarities developed for hypercarnivory, suggesting Canis ambrusteri as the common ancestor for both the North and South American clades.
