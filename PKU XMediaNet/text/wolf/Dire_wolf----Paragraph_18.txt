The Rancho La Brea tar pits located near Los Angeles, California are a collection of sticky asphalt deposits made up of pits which differ in deposition time from 40,000-12,000 YBP. Over 200,000 specimens (fragments) have been recovered from the tar pits, where the remains range from saber-toothed cats to squirrels, invertebrates and plants. The time period includes the Last Glacial Maximum when global temperatures were eight degrees lower than today, the Pleistocene–Holocene transition (Bølling-Allerød interval), the Oldest Dryas cooling, the Younger Dryas cooling 12,800–11,500 YBP, and the American megafaunal extinction event 12,700 YBP when 90 genera of mammals weighing over 44 kilograms became extinct.
