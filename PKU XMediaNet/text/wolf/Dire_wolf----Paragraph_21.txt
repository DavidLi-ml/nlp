All social terrestrial mammalian predators feed mostly on terrestrial herbivorous mammals with a body mass similar to the combined mass of the social group members attacking the prey animal. The large size of dirus provides an estimated prey size in the 300â€“600 kg range. Stable isotope analysis of dirus bones indicate that they had a preference for consuming ruminants such as bison rather than other herbivores but moved to other prey when food became scarce, and occasionally scavenged on beached whales along the Pacific coast when available. A pack of timber wolves can bring down a 500 kg moose that is their preferred prey, and a pack of dire wolves bringing down a bison is conceivable. Although some studies have suggested that because of tooth breakage that dirus gnawed bones and may have been a scavenger, its widespread occurrence and the more gracile limbs of Canis dirus dirus indicate a predator. The dire wolf probably used its molars to crack bones similar to the gray wolf, however due to their larger size it could crack larger bones to give access to bone marrow.
