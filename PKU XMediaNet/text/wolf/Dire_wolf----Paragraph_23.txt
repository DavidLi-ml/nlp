A study of nine modern carnivores found that one in four adults had suffered tooth breakage, of which half of these breakages were of the canine teeth. The study proposed that this breakage was related to behavior, with the most breakage occurring in the spotted hyena that in known to consume all of its prey, including the bone. A later study of the fossil remains of large carnivores from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits that were dated 36,000-10,000 YBP indicated tooth breakage rates of 5-17% for the dirus, coyote, American lion and saber-tooth cat, compared to 0.5-2.7% for 10 modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth and not more often the canine teeth as when compared to the modern carnivores. The dire wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the extant gray wolf, therefore it was proposed that dirus used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Data on dirus fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. The study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth breakage compared with extant carnivores was not the result of hunting larger game because the Pleistocene carnivores were larger than their modern counterparts. Carnivores feed more rapidly when food is scarce and competition is high, often consuming bone. The study proposed that the breakage was due to increased carcass consumption including bone due to low or seasonal prey availability, or greater competition, or both. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago so too did these competing carnivores except for the omnivorous coyote.
