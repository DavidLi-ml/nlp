Canis dirus remains have been found across a broad range of habitats including the plains, grasslands and some forested mountain areas of North America, and in the arid savannah of South America. The sites range in elevation from sea level to 2,255 m (7400 feet). Dire wolf fossils have rarely been found north of 42Â°N latitude, with five unconfirmed reports above it. This range restriction is thought to be due to temperature, prey, or habitat imposed by proximity to the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet that existed at that time.
