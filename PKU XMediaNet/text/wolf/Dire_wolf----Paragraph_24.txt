A later Rancho La Brea tar pits study compared tooth breakage of dirus between two time periods. One pit contained fossil dirus dated 15,000 YBP and another dated 13,000 YBP. The results showed that the 15,000 YBP dirus had three times more tooth breakage than the 13,000 YBP dirus whose breakage matched those of nine modern carnivores. The study concluded that between 15,000-14,000 YBP prey availability was less or that competition was higher for dirus, and by 13,000 YBP as the prey species and dirus moved towards extinction that predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth breakage had also declined.
