Canis dirus was about the same size as the largest extant gray wolves (Canis lupus): the Yukon wolf and the Northwestern wolf. C.d. guildayi weighed on average 60 kg (130 lb) and C.d. dirus on average 68 kg (150 lb). Its skull and dentition matched those of lupus, however its teeth were larger with greater shearing ability, and its biteforce at the canine tooth was the strongest of any known Canis species. These characteristics are thought to be adaptions for preying on Late Pleistocene megaherbivores, and in North America its prey is known to have included horse, sloth, mastodon, bison and camels. As with other large Canis hypercarnivores today, dirus was thought to have been a pack-hunter. Its extinction occurred during the Quaternary extinction event along with its main prey species. Its reliance on megaherbivores has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the cause remains unknown. The latest dire wolf remains were dated to 9,440 years ago.
