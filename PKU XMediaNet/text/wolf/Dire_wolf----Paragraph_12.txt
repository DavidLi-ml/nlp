The age of most dire wolf localities is determined solely by biostratigraphy. Canis dirus and Smilodon fatalis are the two most common carnivorans from the Rancho La Brea tar pits, but biostratigraphy is an unreliable indicator within asphalt deposits. Some sites have been radiocarbon dated, with Canis dirus specimens at La Brea dated in calendar years as follows: 82 specimens dated 13,000-14,000 YBP; 40 specimens dated 14,000-16,000 YBP; 77 specimens dated 14,000-18,000 YBP; 37 specimens dated 17,000-18,000 YBP; 26 specimens dated 21,000-30,000 YBP; 40 specimens dated 25,000-28,000 YBP; and 6 specimens dated 32,000-37,000 YBP. A specimen from Powder Mill Creek Cave, Missouri was dated at 13,170 YBP.
