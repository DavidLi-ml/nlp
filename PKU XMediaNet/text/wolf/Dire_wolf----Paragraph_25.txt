In carnivores, the solitary hunters depend on a powerful canine bite to subdue their prey and these also have a strong mandibular symphysis, while the pack hunters that deliver many shallow bites have a relatively weaker one. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth in order to crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the mandible buttress profile of dirus was lower than that of the gray wolf and the red wolf, but very similar to the coyote and the African hunting dog. The dorsoventrally weak symphyseal region (in comparison to premolars P3 and P4) of dirus indicates that it delivered shallow bites similar to its modern relatives and therefore was a packhunter. This suggests that dirus may have processed bone but was not as well adapted at this as lupus. The fact that the fracture incidence of dirus reduced in frequency in the late Pleistocene to that of its extant relatives indicates that reduced competition allowed dirus to return to a feeding behaviour with a lower amount of bone consumption for which it was best suited for. A later study found that just before extinction dirus carcass utilization was less than among large carnivores today.
