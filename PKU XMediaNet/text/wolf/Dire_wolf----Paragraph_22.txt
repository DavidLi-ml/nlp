A study of carbon and nitrogen isotope data of Rancho La Brea dirus fossils dated 10,000 YBP indicated that the horse was at that time an important prey species, and that sloth, mastodon, bison and camel were less common in the dirus diet. This indicates that dirus was not a prey specialist, and at the close of the Late Pleistocene in the La Brea area before extinction it was hunting or scavenging off the most available herbivores.
