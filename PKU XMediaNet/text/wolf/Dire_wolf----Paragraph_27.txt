Canis dirus remains have been found across a broad range of habitats including the plains, grasslands and some forested mountain areas of North America, and in the arid savannah of South America. The sites range in elevation from sea level to 2,255 m (7400 feet). The location of its fossil remains suggests that it lived predominantly in the open lowlands along with its prey the large herbivores. Canis dirus does not occur at high latitudes, unlike its close relative, Canis lupus.
