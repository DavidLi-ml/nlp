C. dirus was the largest of all Canis species. A study of the length and circumference of femur bones estimated the mean body mass of Canis dirus guildayi to be 60 kg (130 lb) and Canis dirus dirus to be 68 kg (150 lb). Another study proposed that the increased stress caused in the humerus when running at maximum speed may have imposed a biomechanical upper limit on the body mass for Canis dirus dirus to be 110 kg (240 lb). In comparison, the mean body mass of the extant gray wolf was 40 kg (88 lb) (with the smallest specimen recorded at 12 kg (26 lb) and the largest at 80 kg (176 lb)). The figures indicate that on average dire wolves were the same size as the Yukon wolf (Canis lupus pambasileus) and the Northwestern wolf (Canis lupus occidentalis), with the largest individuals possibly exceeding this size.
