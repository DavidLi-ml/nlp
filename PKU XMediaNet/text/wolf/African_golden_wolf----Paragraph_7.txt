The canids present in Egypt in particular were noted to be so much more grey wolf-like than populations elsewhere in Africa that Hemprich and Ehrenberg gave them the binomial name Canis lupaster in 1832. Likewise, Thomas Henry Huxley, upon noting the similarities between the skulls of lupaster and Indian grey wolves, classed the animal as a subspecies of grey wolf. However, the animal was subsequently synonymised with the golden jackal by Ernst Schwarz in 1926. This classification remained unquestioned until 1981, when zoologist Walter Ferguson of Tel Aviv University argued in favour of lupaster being a subspecies of grey wolf based on cranial measurements, stating that the classing of the animal as a jackal was based solely on the animal's small size, and predated the discovery of C. l. arabs, which is intermediate in size between C. l. lupus and lupaster.
