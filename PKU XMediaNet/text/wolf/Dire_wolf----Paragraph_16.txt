A study of the estimated bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite force at the canines (in Newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), then followed among the extant canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of dirus was similar to that of its living relatives, and assuming that dirus was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to extant canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force rating of the bone-consuming feliform, the spotted hyena (117), challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary in order to consume bone.
