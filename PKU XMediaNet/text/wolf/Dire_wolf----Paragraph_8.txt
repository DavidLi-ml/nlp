The discovery of a fossil in the Horse Room of the Salamander Cave in the Black Hills of South Dakota may possibly be dirus, and if so then it is also one of the earliest records. The specimen was catalogued as Canis cf. C. dirus (where cf. in Latin means confer, uncertain). A horse fossil found in the room gave a uranium-series dating of 252,000 years before present (YBP) and the Canis cf. dirus specimen was assumed to be from the same period. If the material is dirus than it would be a late Irvingtonian record of the species, however the identity of the earliest fossils is not confirmed.
