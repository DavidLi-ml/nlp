A study of the landmark cranial measurements and jaw musculature of dirus found no significant differences with extant lupus in all but 4 of 15 measures. Upper dentition was the same except that dirus had larger dimensions and the P4 had a relatively larger, more massive blade which indicates enhanced slicing ability at the carnassial. The jaw indicated that dirus had a relatively broader and more massive temporalis muscle, indicating that it could generate slightly more bite-force than lupus. However, due to the jaw arrangement dirus had lower temporalis leverage than lupus at the lower carnassial and lower P4, and the functional significance of this is not known. The lower premolars were relatively slightly larger than lupus, and the dirus M1 was much larger and had more shearing ability. The dire wolf canines had greater bending strength than those of extant canids of equivalent size. These differences indicate that dirus was able to deliver stronger bites, and together with flexible and more rounded canines indicates that it was adapted for struggling with its prey. One study that compared the craniodental morphology of dirus to lupus noted the similarity in skull shape between the two, and the variations found in the skull shape of each, and proposed that dirus evolved in North America from lupus that had originated in Eurasia.
