The late Irvingtonian wolf Aenocyon dirus nebrascensis (Frick 1930 undescribed) fossil specimens from four sites in the Hay Springs area in Sheridan County, Nebraska, may represent the earliest record of the largely Rancholabrean Canis dirus, according to both Frick and Tedford. Nowak referred to the material as Canis armbrusteri, however Tedford formally recorded a description of the material and noted that although these specimens exhibited some morphological characteristics of both ambrusteri and dirus, he referred to the material as Canis dirus. The three noted paleontologists X. Wang, R. H. Tedford and R. M. Nowak have all proposed that dirus had evolved from armbrusteri, with Nowak stating that there were specimens from Cumberland Cave, Maryland that indicated C. ambrusteri diverging into C. dirus. The two taxa share a number of characteristics (synapomorphy), which suggests an origin of dirus in the late Irvingtonian in the open terrain in the midcontinent, and then later expanding eastward and displacing armbrusteri. The timing of dirus would therefore be the Late Irvingtonian of California and Nebraska, and the Rancholabrean of Canada, the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru, however the identity of the earliest fossils is not confirmed.
