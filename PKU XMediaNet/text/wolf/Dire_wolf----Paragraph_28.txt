In the United States, its fossils have been reported in Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. However, the identity of fossils reported further north than California are not confirmed. Dire wolf fossils have rarely been found north of 42Â°N latitude, with five unconfirmed reports above it: Fossil Lake, Oregon (Late Pleistocene), American Falls Reservoir, Idaho (Sangamonian), Salamander Cave, South Dakota (Irvingtonian), and four closely-grouped sites in northern Nebraska (Irvingtonian). This indicates a range restriction on dirus due to temperature, prey, or habitat. The major fossil-producing sites for C.d. dirus are located east of the Rocky Mountains and include Friesenhahn Cave, Texas, Carroll Cave, Missouri, and Reddick, Florida.
