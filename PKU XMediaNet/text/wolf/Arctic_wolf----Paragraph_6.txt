The Arctic wolf population also began to decrease as human populations became more dense in certain areas. In east Greenland the Arctic wolf was exterminated completely by Danish and Norwegian hunters. In 1979, they began to repopulate the area and successfully establish a new population of wolves. The first wolf was spotted in April 1978 in eastern north Greenland. During the year of 1980, several wolf pairs were reported throughout eastern Greenland by military patrols. Wolves could not recover during the years between 1939â€“1978 in east Greenland due to factors such as geography and limited resources. Prey was insufficient and a dispersal corridor was hidden at 79 degrees north, thus restricting access to east Greenland. Also inadvertently, human mediated transport may have contributed to their repopulation in east Greenland. There are studies showing invading wolves of 1979 coming from the north, following tracks left by a military sled patrol.
