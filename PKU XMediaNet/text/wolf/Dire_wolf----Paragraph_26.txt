Past studies have indicated that changes in dirus body size correlates with climate fluctuations. A later study compared dirus craniodental morphology from 4 La Brea pits, each representing four different time periods. The results indicated a change in dirus size, dental wear and breakage, skull shape and snout shape across time. Dire wolf body size had decreased between the start of the Last Glacial Maximum and near its ending at the warm Allerød oscillation. Food stress is indicated by a smaller body size, skulls with the larger cranial base and shorter snouts (shape neotony and size neoteny), and more tooth breakage and wear. Canis dirus dated 17,900 YBP showed all of these features, which indicated food stress. Canis dirus dated 28,000 YBP also showed to a degree many of these features but were the largest wolves studied, and it was proposed that these wolves were also suffering from food stress and that wolves earlier to this date were even bigger in size. Nutrient stress is likely to lead to stronger bite forces to more fully consume carcasses and to crack bones, and with changes to skull shape to improve mechanical advantage. North American climate records revealed cyclic fluctuations during the glacial period that included rapid warming followed by gradual cooling, called Dansgaard–Oeschger events. These cycles would have caused increased temperature and aridity, and at La Brea would have caused ecological stress and therefore food stress. A similar trend was found with C. lupus, which in the Santa Barbara basin was originally massive, robust and possibly convergent with dirus, but was replaced by more gracile forms by the start of the Holocene.
