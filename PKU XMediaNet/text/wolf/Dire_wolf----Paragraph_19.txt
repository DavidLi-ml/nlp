At La Brea, predatory birds and mammals were attracted to dead or dying herbivores that had become mired, and then these predators became trapped themselves. The estimated herbivore entrapment was estimated to have occurred once every fifty years, and for every herbivore remains that was found in the pits there were ten carnivores. Canis dirus guildayi and Smilodon fatalis are the two most common carnivorans from Rancho La Brea, with dirus the most common. Remains of dirus outnumber remains of lupus in the tar pits by a ratio of five to one. During the Last Glacial Maximum, coastal California is thought to have been a refuge with the climate slightly cooler and wetter than today, and a comparison of the frequency of dirus and other predator remains at La Brea to other parts of California and North America indicated significantly greater abundances, therefore the higher dirus numbers in the La Brea region did not reflect the wider area.
