The eastern wolf (Canis lycaon or Canis lupus lycaon), also known as the eastern timber wolf, Algonquin wolf or deer wolf, is a canid native to the northeastern side of North America's Great Lakes region. It is a medium-sized canid which, like the red wolf, is intermediate in size between the coyote and Northwestern wolf. It primarily preys on white-tailed deer, but may occasionally attack moose and beaver.
