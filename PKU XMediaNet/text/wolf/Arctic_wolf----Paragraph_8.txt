Habitat quality is the capability of east Greenland to support a wolf population by stipulating adequate prey for wolves to survive and breed. If lack of prey was associated in the decline of the Arctic wolf, then has been an increase in unfavorable weather that caused over-icing and food shortage amongst muskoxen. This factor predicted that one or more severe over-icing events occurred during the 1920s, resulting in calamitous mortality among muskoxen, or that wolves were reported to be abundant enough to reduce the muskox population.
