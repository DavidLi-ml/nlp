In 2015, a more thorough comparative study of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes on a larger sample of wolf-like African canids from north, east and west Africa showed that they were in fact all distinct from the Eurasian golden jackal, with a genetic divergence of around 6.7%, which is greater than that between grey wolves and coyotes (4%) and that between grey wolves and domestic dogs (0.2%). Furthermore, the study showed that these African wolf-like canids (renamed Canis anthus, or African golden wolves) were more closely related to grey wolves and coyotes than to Eurasian golden jackals, and that C. a. lupaster merely represents a distinct phenotype of African wolf rather than an actual grey wolf. The phylogenetic tree below is based on nuclear sequences:
