The African wolf's life centres around a home burrow, which usually consists of an abandoned and modified aardvark or warthog earth. The interior structure of this burrow is poorly understood, though it is thought to consist of a single central chamber with 2â€“3 escape routes. The home burrow can be located in both secluded areas or surprisingly near the dens of other predators.
