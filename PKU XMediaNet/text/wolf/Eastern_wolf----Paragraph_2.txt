The eastern wolf is currently listed as a threatened species under COSEWIC and with the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO), because "new genetic analyses indicate that the eastern wolf is not a subspecies of grey wolf" versus earlier theories that it was a result of hybridization with both gray wolves and coyotes. The eastern wolf is particularly susceptible to hybridization, due to its close relationship to the coyote and its ability to bridge gene flow between both coyotes and gray wolves. Furthermore, human persecution over a period of 400 years caused a population decline which reduced the number of suitable mates, thus facilitating coyote gene swamping into the eastern wolf population. Aside from posing a threat to a unique species, the resulting eastern wolfâ€“coyote hybrids are too small in size to substitute pure eastern wolves as apex predators of moose and deer. The main nucleus of pure eastern wolves is currently concentrated within Algonquin Provincial Park, south central Ontario and south central Quebec. However, a 2016 study concluded that even these eastern wolves have about 32% coyote ancestry.
