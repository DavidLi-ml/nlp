In 2010, a study of dental characteristics and DNA analyses of all South American extant canids and fossil hypercanivorous canids found that these could be divided into a Canis clade and a "South American clade". The study found that Canis dirus was a sister taxon of Canis lupus. Canis gezi was classified under the "South American clade" but dirus and C. nehringi were included as derived species in the Canis clade. The study indicated that dirus and C. nehringi were the same species, which supports dirus having migrated from North America into South America.
