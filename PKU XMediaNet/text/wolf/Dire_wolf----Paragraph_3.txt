Canis dirus was named by Joseph Leidy in 1858. The first specimen of what would become later associated with dirus was found in the summer of 1854 at Evansville, Indiana when the Ohio River was low. The specimen, a fossilized jawbone, was obtained by Joseph Granville Norwood from an Evansville collector named Francis A. Linck. Leidy determined the specimen represented an extinct species of wolf and reported it under the name of Canis primaevus. Norwood's letters to Leidy are preserved along with the type specimen at the Academy of Natural Sciences. In 1857, while exploring the Niobrara River valley in Nebraska, Leidy found the vertebrae of an extinct canis which he reported the following year under the name Canis dirus. Canis primaevus (Leidy 1854) was later renamed Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869) when Leidy discovered that the name Canis primaevus had previously been used overseas.
