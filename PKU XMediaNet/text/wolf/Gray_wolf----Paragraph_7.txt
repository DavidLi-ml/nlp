Dogs and gray wolves do not voluntarily interbreed in the wild, though they can produce fertile wolf-dog offspring. In North America, black colored wolves acquired their coloration from wolf-dog hybridization, which occurred 10,000â€“15,000 years ago. Like pure wolves, hybrids breed once annually, though their mating season occurs three months earlier, with pups mostly being born in the winter period, thus lessening their chances of survival. However, one genetic study undertaken in the Caucasus Mountains showed that as many as 10% of dogs in the area, including livestock guardian dogs, are first generation hybrids. The captive breeding of wolf-dog hybrids has proliferated in the USA, with 300,000 such animals being present there.
