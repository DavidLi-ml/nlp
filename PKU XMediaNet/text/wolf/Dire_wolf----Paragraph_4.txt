Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869) was first associated with Canis dirus (Leidy 1858) by Allen in 1876 along with his discovery of Canis mississippiensis. As there were so few pieces of these 3 specimens, it was thought best to leave each listed under these 3 provisional names until more material could be provided to show their relationship. Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869) was declared a subjective synonym with Canis dirus by Troxell in 1915. In 1918, Merriam studied these fossils and proposed consolidating their names under the separate genus Aenocyon (from Aenos:terrible and cyon:wolf) to become Aenocyon dirus, however not everyone agreed with leaving genus Canis. Canis ayersi (Sellards 1916) and Aenocyon dirus (Merriam 1918) were subjective synonyms with Canis dirus by Lundelius in 1972. All of the above taxa were declared as subjective synonyms with Canis dirus according to Nowak in 1979, except for Aenocyon dirus nebrascensis.
