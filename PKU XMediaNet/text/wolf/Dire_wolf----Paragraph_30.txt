In South America, dirus has been dated younger than 17,000 YBP and reported from only three localities: Muaco, Venezuela; Talara, Peru; and Tarija, Bolivia. If Canis dirus originated in North America, the species likely dispersed into South America via the Andean corridor, a proposed pathway for temperate mammals to migrate from Central to South America because of the favorable cool, dry and open habitats that characterized the region at times. This most likely happened during a glacial period, however, as the pathway then consisted of open, arid regions and savanna whereas during inter-glacial periods it would have been characterized by tropical rain forest habitat.
