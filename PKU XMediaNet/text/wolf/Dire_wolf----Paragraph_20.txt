Assuming that only a small number of the carnivores that were feeding became trapped, it is likely that fairly sizeable groups of dirus fed together on these occasions. Sexual dimorphism is the difference between the male and female of a species apart from their sex organs and there is little variance among the canids regardless of their group size. A study of the skull length, canine tooth size, and lower molar length of dirus remains, dated between 15,360â€“14,310 YBP and taken from one pit, showed little dimorphism and therefore indicated that dirus lived in monogamous pairs. The level of dimorphism was similar to that of the gray wolf. Their large size and highly carnivorous dentition indicates that dirus was a predator that feeds on large prey. In order to kill ungulates larger than themselves the African wild dog, the dhole, and the gray wolf depend on their jaws because they cannot use their forelimbs to grapple with prey, and they work together as a pack that consist of an alpha pair and their offspring from the current and previous years. It can be assumed that dirus lived in packs of relatives that were led by an alpha pair. Large and social carnivores would have been successful at defending carcasses of trapped prey from smaller solitary predators, and the most likely to become trapped themselves, which indicates that both Canis dirus guildayi and Smilodon fatalis were social predators.
