The dire wolf (Canis dirus, "fearsome dog") is an extinct species of the genus Canis. It is perhaps one of the most famous prehistoric carnivores in North America along with its extinct competitor Smilodon, the "sabre-toothed cat". Canis dirus lived in the Americas during the Late Pleistocene epoch (125,000â€“10,000 years ago). The species was named in 1858 but the first specimen had been found in 1854 in Ohio, USA. Two subspecies are recognized: Canis dirus guildayi and Canis dirus dirus. The species probably descended from Canis ambrusteri and evolved from it in North America. The largest collection of dirus fossils has been obtained from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California.
