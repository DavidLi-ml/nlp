The eastern wolf's taxonomic classification has been under review beginning c. 2000, with various suggestions having been presented as to its derivation, including its being a subspecies of gray wolf, its being conspecific with the red wolf, gray wolfâ€“coyote hybridization, and classification as a separate species within Canis. The eastern wolf is still recognized as a gray wolf subspecies by Mammal Species of the World (as of 2005), but in 2013, following a comprehensive review of several genetic studies, it has been classed as a distinct species by United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
