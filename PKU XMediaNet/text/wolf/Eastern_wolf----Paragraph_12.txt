Before the arrival of Europeans, eastern wolves may have numbered at 64,500â€“90,200 individuals. The species ranged throughout the wooded and open areas of eastern North America, from the Maritime provinces and southern Quebec to approximately the southern United States and westward to the Great Plains. The region's indigenous human populations didn't fear eastern wolves, though they did occasionally catch them in traps, and their bones occur in native shell heaps. The earliest written records of the eastern wolf were in the writings of Jacques Cartier in 1535 and in Marc Lescarbot's Histoire de la Nouvelle-France (1609), where he wrote that the animal was common in Acadia.
