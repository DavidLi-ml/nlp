The inflation system usually consists of a pressurized cylinder, a regulating valve, two high pressure hoses and two aspirators. The cylinder can be from 100 to about 1000 cubic inches, filled to about 3000 psi with either gaseous Nitrogen, or a mixture of gaseous CO2 and Nitrogen. Once made of steel, most cylinders now are made of aluminum or alloy cores wrapped with fiberglass, or other lightweight, fuel saving materials. The CO2 is used to slow down the rate at which the valve expends the gases.
