Airplanes such as the Embraer 145 family, Fokker 50 family, Antonov An-148 family, ATR family and the Bombardier CRJ-200 family do not have escape slides because all exits are at a distance from the ground (less than 6 feet (1.8 m)), below which evacuation assisting devices are not required by regulations. On the primary entrance door, 1L, some of these aircraft have stairs that are either connected to the door or drop down.
