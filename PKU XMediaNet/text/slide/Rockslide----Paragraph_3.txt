Mass-wasting occurs whenever gravitational pressure exceeds the affected slopes ability to resist its pressure. Therefore, anything that erodes or impedes the mountain's ability to resist this force may be one of the causes of mass-wasting. While a major event such as an earthquake can cause large rockslides to happen, a majority of slides occur due to a combination of gravitational pressure and erosional influences.
