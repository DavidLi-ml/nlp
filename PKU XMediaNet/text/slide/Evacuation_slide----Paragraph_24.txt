The valve is used to mechanically meter out the gas at a rate of roughly 3 - 600 psi and 4 CFM. Typically there are two high pressure hoses attached to the valve, which are connected at the other end to aspirators. These are usually cylindrical, hollow aluminum tubes with sliding cylindrical or internal flapper doors that open when high pressure gas is applied, and close when the gas stream subsides and the internal slide back pressure reaches about 2.5 - 3.0 psi. They work on the Venturi principle, and draw outside air into the evacuation unit at a rate of about 500:1. A 750 in3 (0.43 ft3) cylinder can fill a slide with about 850 cu ft (24 m3) of air to a pressure of about 3 psi in about 4â€“6 seconds.
