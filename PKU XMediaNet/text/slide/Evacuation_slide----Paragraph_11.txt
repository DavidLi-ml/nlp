A ramp slide is an evacuation slide that has a small platform between the exit and the slide itself, and is used mainly where the proximity of the exit to an engine requires the slide to be angled away from the engine to prevent damage. Airbus A310, Airbus 340-600, Airbus A380 and Boeing 747 aircraft have ramp slide attachments for their overwing evacuation slides. The overwing exits on the Airbus A320 series, Boeing 757-variant and Boeing 767-variant aircraft also use ramp slide attachments.
