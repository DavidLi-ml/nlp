The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo caused lahar flows: the first eruption itself killed six people, but the lahar flows killed more than 1500. The eye of Typhoon Yunya passed over the volcano during its eruption on June 15, 1991. The rain from the typhoon triggered the flow of volcanic ash, boulders, and water down the rivers surrounding the volcano. Angeles City was damaged by the volcano's sticky mud when Sapang Balen Creek and the Abacan River became the channel for the lahar and carried it to the heart of the city.
