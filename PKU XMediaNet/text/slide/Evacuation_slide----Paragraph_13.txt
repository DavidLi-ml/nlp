Certain evacuation slides do not use a slide bustle on the door as a container. Instead, the slide is "fuselage mounted" and is attached to a container located underneath or below the exit close to the aircraft exterior. This design of slide is found in the Airbus A321 aircraft at the emergency doors, and typically at all overwing evacuation slides other than the Boeing 747-400 series aircraft.
