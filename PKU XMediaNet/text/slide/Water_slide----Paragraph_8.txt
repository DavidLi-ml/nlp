A bowl is a type of water slide where riders descend a steep drop into a round bowl. They then circle the outer area of the bowl before exiting down through the middle. This style of water slide comes in various styles and is manufactured by ProSlide, WhiteWater West and Waterfun Products. The different variations can be ridden on a 4-person cloverleaf tube, 2 person inline tube, single person tube or as a body slide.
