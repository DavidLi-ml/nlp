A stocky, medium-sized (40–42 centimetres or 16–17 inches in length) forest crow, this sociable bird can be found quite commonly over most of the large island of Cuba and on the nearby Isla de la Juventud in woodland and areas that have been cleared for agriculture. It is frequently found around farms and villages where it seems to have adapted quite well to living in relatively close contact with man.
