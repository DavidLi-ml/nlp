Crows reach sexual maturity around the age of 3 years for females and 5 years for males. Clutch size is approximately three to 9 eggs, and the nesting period lasts between 20 and 40 days. Crows often mate for life, and young from previous years often help nesting pairs protect a nest and feed nestlings.
