The Cuban crow (Corvus nasicus) is one of four species of crow that occur on a few key islands in the Caribbean. It is closely related to the white-necked crow (C. leucognaphalis) and Jamaican crow (C. jamaicensis), with which it shares similar features. The fourth Caribbean crow, the palm crow (C. palmarum), is a later arrival in evolutionary terms and shows characteristics more akin to North American species such as the fish crow (C. ossifragus), which it is probably closely related to.
