Crows are omnivorous, and their diet is very diverse. They will eat almost anything, including other birds, fruits, nuts, mollusks, earthworms, seeds, frogs, eggs, nestlings, mice, and carrion. The origin of placing scarecrows in grain fields resulted from the crowâ€™s incessant damaging and scavenging, although crows assist farmers by eating insects otherwise attracted to their crops.
