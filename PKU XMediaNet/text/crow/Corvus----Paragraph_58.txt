In Sons of Anarchy, the founding charter Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original (SAMCRO) is often referred to as "Sam Crow", its members as crows, and its groupies as "crow-eaters", and black crows figure largely in the show's symbolism, including the opening credits and the closing scene of the series finale.
