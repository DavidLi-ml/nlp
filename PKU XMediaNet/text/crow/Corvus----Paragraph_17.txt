Crows have demonstrated the ability to distinguish individual humans by recognizing facial features. Evidence also suggests they are one of the few nonhuman animals, along with insects like bees or ants, capable of displacement (communicate about things that are not immediately present, spatially or temporally). Ravens have been observed to recruit other ravens to large feeding sites, such as to the carcass of an animal.
