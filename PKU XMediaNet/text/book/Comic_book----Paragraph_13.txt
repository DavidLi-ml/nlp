In the 1970s, specialty comic stores began opening and they still have a place in today's society. Initially, the target audience of comic books was only children, however, with the introduction of devoted comic book stores, they are now embraced by many adults. Due to their greater income, comic book companies have been pushed to create comics aimed at adult readers.
