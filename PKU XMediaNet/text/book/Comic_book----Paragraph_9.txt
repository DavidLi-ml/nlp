By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as Pacific, Eclipse, First, Comico, and Fantagraphics - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formatsâ€”from color-superhero, detective, and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of Latin American magical realism.
