A dynamic tilt wheelchair has seating surfaces which can be tilted to various angles. It was developed by an orthotist, Hugh Barclay, who worked with disabled children and observed that postural deformities such as scoliosis could be supported or partially corrected by allowing the wheelchair user to relax in a tilted position. Invented in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in the early 1980s, the dynamic tilt wheelchair type is now manufactured by a number of companies and used all around the world. This revolutionary adaptation of wheelchair design provides individuals with very complex health needs the opportunity for increased mobility.
