An electric-powered wheelchair is a wheelchair that is moved via the means of an electric motor and navigational controls which is usually a small joystick mounted on the armrest, rather than manual power. For users who cannot manage a manual joystick, headswitches, chin-operated joysticks, sip-and-puff or other specialist controls may allow independent operation of the wheelchair.
