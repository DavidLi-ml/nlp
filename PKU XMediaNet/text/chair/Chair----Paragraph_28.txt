A couch, bench, or other arrangement of seats next to each other may have armrest at the sides and/or arm rests in between. The latter may be provided for comfort, but also for privacy (e.g. in public transport and other public places), and to prevent lying down on the bench. Arm rests reduce both desired and undesired proximity. A loveseat in particular, has no armrest in between two seating positions.
