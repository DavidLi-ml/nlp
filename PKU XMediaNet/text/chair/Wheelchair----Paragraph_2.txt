The earliest records of wheeled furniture was an inscription found on a stone slate in China and a childâ€™s bed depicted in a frieze on a Greek vase, both dating back to the 5th century BCE. The first records of wheeled seats being used for transporting the disabled date to three centuries later in China; the Chinese used their invented wheelbarrow to move people as well as heavy objects. A distinction between the two functions was not made for another several hundred years, around 525 CE, when images of wheeled chairs made specifically to carry people begin to occur in Chinese art.
