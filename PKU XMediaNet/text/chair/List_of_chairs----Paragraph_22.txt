Farthingale chair, an armless chair with a wide seat covered in usually high-quality fabric and fitted with a cushion. The backrest is an upholstered panel, with legs that are straight and rectangular. It was introduced as a chair for ladies in the late 16th century and was named in England, probably in the 19th century, for its ability to accommodate the exceptionally wide-hooped skirts fashionable of the time.
