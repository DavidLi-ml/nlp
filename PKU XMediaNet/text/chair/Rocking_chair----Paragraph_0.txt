A rocking chair or rocker is a type of chair with two curved bands (also known as rockers and A sometimes a "school boys chair") attached to the bottom of the legs, connecting the legs on each side to each other. The rockers contact the floor at only two points, giving the occupant the ability to rock back and forth by shifting his/her weight or pushing lightly with his/her feet. Rocking chairs are most commonly made of wood. Some rocking chairs can fold.
