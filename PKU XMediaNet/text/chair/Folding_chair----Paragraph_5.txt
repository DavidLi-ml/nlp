The folding chair became especially widespread during the Middle Ages. It was treasured as a liturgical furniture piece. Since the 15th and 16th centuries the folding chair has mostly had arm and head rests. Of course, newer chairs which are often found in functions and events are also called folding chairs. The folding chairs were very easy to use and bring to different places such as parties or family gatherings.
