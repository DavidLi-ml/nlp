Many adults find rocking chairs soothing because of the gentle motion. One's brain may associate the rocking motion with that of the safety and comfort felt when rocking in a mother's arms or in a cradle or perhaps even a mother's womb. It has been shown that the motion of gentle rocking relaxes the body and allows people to sleep better.
