The Bowie knife has also appeared in Television and Cinema such as the largely fictional 1952 Alan Ladd film loosely based on the life of James Bowie 'The Iron Mistress' and the 'Jim Bowie' Television series of the 1950s. At the end of John Ford's film 'The Searchers' (1958) John Wayne's character Ethan Edwards uses a Bowie knife to scalp the Comanche Indian chief 'Scar' he has been hunting throughout the film.
