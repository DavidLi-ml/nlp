The Bowie knife obviously derives part of its name and reputation from James Bowie, a notorious knife fighter, who died at the Alamo. James Bowie left a very thin paper trail; in the absence of verifiable facts his history was buried in unverifiable knife-fighting legend. Historians seriously entertain the possibility that Bowie only fought one personal knife fight (and that was not fought with a blade meeting the modern definition if Rezin Bowie's account is true). That Sandbar Fight received national publicity (accounts in Philadelphia, New York, and the Niles' Register of Washington, D.C.) within months of the event. James Bowie prominently wore a large knife after the Sandbar fight.
