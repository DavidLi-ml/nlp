In modern-day Texas, the state Jim Bowie died defending, the carrying of a Bowie knife "on or about one's person" in public places is specifically regulated under state law. This prohibition does not apply to a person carrying the Bowie knife on one's own property, private properties etc. nor to any person carrying a Bowie knife inside of or directly en route to a motor vehicle or watercraft owned by that person or under that person's control.
