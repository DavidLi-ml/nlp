The dipole aspects are also relatively fixed. The jet orifice dimension and the distance to the edge, h is fixed. Although the jet speed U can vary, the fluid mechanical Strouhal number is relatively constant and normally operates in Stage I. When there is phase coherent gain of the two aspects, they operate as Class III monopole sources. The efficiency of the monopole radiation is considerably greater than that of the dipole so the dipole pattern is noticed, The details of system gain and interaction between these two dynamic systems is yet to be fully uncovered. It is a testimony to the skills of early instrument makers that they were able to achieve the right port sizes and positions for a given note without scientific measurement instruments.
