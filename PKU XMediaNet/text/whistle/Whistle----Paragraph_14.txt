This results in a non-uniform sound field, unlike the monopole whistle. Real whistles are only approximations to this idealized model. Although tuning forks are not whistles, they create sound fields that are very close to the idealized dipole model. Nevertheless, much can be learned about whistles with the useful form of the sound power equation for the dipole. Using the definitions below, it can be expressed as
