At high speeds U, the flow is turbulent and in some studies the speed can be supersonic and the sound generated can be quite high level. One study has shown that several modes of oscillation (stages) can occur in a shallow cavity; the modes being related to the number of vortices in the distance L. For shorter cavities and lower Mach Numbers, there is a shear-layer mode, while for longer cavities and higher Mach Numbers there is a wake mode. The shear-layer mode is characterized well by the feedback process described by Rossiter. The wake mode is characterized instead by a large-scale vortex shedding with a Strouhal number independent of Mach number. There is an empirical equation for these data; it is called Rossiterâ€™s formula.
