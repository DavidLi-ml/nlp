In a rectangular jet, the instability can show as asymmetric cell distortions. The asymmetry sends waves back to the nozzle which sets up a Class III feedback loop and a strong periodic dipole sound field; it is called screech tone. Powell first described the phenomenon and because of application to military aircraft and potential structural fatigue, much subsequent work has been done. The sound field is sufficiently intense for it to appear on a shadowgraph as shown in the figure on the right (from M.G. Davies) for a rectangular supersonic jet. The dipole nature of the source is clear by the phase reversal on either side of the jet. There is lateral motion of the shock cells that gives the dipole its axis.
