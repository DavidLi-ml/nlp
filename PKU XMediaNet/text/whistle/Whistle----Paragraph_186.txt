A number of musical instruments, other than the pipe organ, are based on the edge tone phenomenon, the most common of which are the flute, the piccolo (a small version of the flute), and the recorder. The flute can be blown lateral to the instrument or at the end as the other ones are. A native end blown flute is shown in the figure.
