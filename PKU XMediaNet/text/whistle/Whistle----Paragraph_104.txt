A particular shaped object is placed within a pipe and a pressure sensor is embedded either in the pipe wall or in the inserted object. Although a number of shapes have been used, there are several that work well. The figure on the right shows data from a meter called the Deltameter. The inserted shape was that of a trapezoid with the wider end facing upstream. The graph shows a nearly linear relationship with flow speed over nearly a 1000 to 1 range of Reynolds Numbers (12,530 to 1,181,000). Orifice plates as flow meters typically have a 5 to 1 speed range, while turbine meters may have up to 100 to 1 range.
