The back reaction of the medium is an determinant of source motion. In many important cases, linear thinking (small cause = small effect) is fallacious. Unstable fluid motion or the sound generated by it can feedback to the source and control it, much like audio feedback squeal. The basic requirements for a feedback controlled system are: (1) a source of steady power; (2) an amplification mechanism that can convert the steady power to time varying power; (3) a disturbance which supplies the oscillations to be amplified; (4) a means of generating sound or other oscillatory fluid motion; and (5) a means for feedback of that oscillatory motion as a disturbance to the input of the amplifier. Whistles are in this category. There are several ways to describe the feedback process.
