Early studies have used the term stage to describe the possible states of feedback as shown schematically in the figure on the right. As the flow speed increases (Reynolds number - Re) the frequency slowly climbs (nearly constant Strouhal number -St) but then the frequency jumps up abruptly to a higher stage. As the flow speed is later decreased the frequency slowly decreases but then jumps down abruptly to a lower stage. This pattern is called a hysteresis loop.
