An approximate way to relate the sound generated to the flow characteristics is to perturb the standard drag equation with velocity perturbations as shown in the upper equation below.(lift measurements for cylinders are generally not available). The upper equation is the modified drag equation with both drag component u and lift component v and the cross sectional area dL where d is the cylinder diameter and w is the length.
