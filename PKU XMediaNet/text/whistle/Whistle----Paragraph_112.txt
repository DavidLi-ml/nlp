The figure on the right shows an example. A boundary layer flow was created on both sides of a thin rigid flat plate which terminated with a square trailing edge. Note the nearly pure tone at 2000 Hz with a Strouhal number of 0.21 protruding above the turbulent sound spectrum. Once again the magic number of Strouhal appears. The characteristic speed was the mean speed of the jet, U and the characteristic dimension was chosen as the trailing edge thickness.t. The better characteristic dimension would have been the boundary layer thickness, but fortunately the two dimensions were almost the same. The measured sound field was clearly dipole-like (modified slightly by the plate presence).
