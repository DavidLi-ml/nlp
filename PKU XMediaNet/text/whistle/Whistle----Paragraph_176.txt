There are two characteristic dimensions (cavity width L associated with vortex development and cavity depth D associated with acoustical response). There are two characteristic speeds (flow speed U associated with vortex development and sound speed associated with cavity response). It was found that the feedback was Class III and the Strouhal Numbers ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 were associated with a single vortex pattern (Stage I) across the gap while Strouhal numbers ranging from 0.6 to 0.9 were associated with two vortices across the gap (Stage II).
