The method of creating swirl in the vortex whistle was considered the cause for lack of dynamic similarity, so the swirl was created in a pipe with a contraction having swirl blades followed by an expansion to create the required axial backflow. This was the vortex whistle in a pipe. Measurements made with this geometry, are shown in the figure on the right. As can be seen, dynamic similarity was achieved with both air and water. This whistle became a flow meter called the swirlmeter. Its accuracy rivals that of the vortex shedding meters described above but has a higher pressure drop. The feedback is hydrodynamic (Class I) and only one stage was found.
