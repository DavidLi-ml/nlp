Manipulation of the equation yields the lower two equations for the dipole sound power of both lift and drag. Each time a vortex is shed, the drag velocity fluctuation u has the same sign, but the lateral velocity fluctuation v, has opposite signs, since the vortex is shed on alternate sides. As a result, The drag dipole would be expected to be twice the frequency of the lift dipole.
