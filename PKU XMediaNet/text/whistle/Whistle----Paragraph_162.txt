The characteristic speed, U, is that in the exit plane, and the characteristic dimension L is the nozzle width, to which the cell dimensions are proportional. Circular supersonic jets also generate screech tones. In this case, however, there can be three modes of motion: symmetric (toroidal), asymmetric (sinuous), and helical. These whistles are unlike the others listed above; the sound is generated without interaction with a solid; it is truly an aerodynamic whistle.
