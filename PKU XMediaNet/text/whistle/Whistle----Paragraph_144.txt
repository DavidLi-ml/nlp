   was confirmed by Powell. Numerical simulations of the edge tone and extensive references can be found in a NASA report. The lower figure on the right may be called a wake edge tone. If the preferred frequencies of the trailing edge instability match the preferred frequencies of the free edge tone, a stronger dipole sound should arise. There does not appear to be any research on this configuration.
