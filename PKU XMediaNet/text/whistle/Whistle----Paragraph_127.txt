The word "ring" here refers to something akin to that worn on the finger and not the sound from a cellphone. The flow from a circular orifice impinging on a toroidal ring of the same diameter as the orifice will result in a tone; it is called a ring tone. It is similar to the hole tone described above except that because the plate was replaced by a ring a fundamental change in the resultant sound field occurs. Small disturbances at the ring feed back to the orifice to be amplified by the flow instability (Class I). The unstable flow creates a set of symmetric (ring) vortices that later impinge on the physical ring.
