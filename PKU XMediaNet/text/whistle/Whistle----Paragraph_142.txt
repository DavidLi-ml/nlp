As found in the Aeolian tone, the vertical component (lift) is large and results in a dipole-like sound field at the wedge (shown in the lower figure) and a much weaker horizontal component (drag) at twice the frequency (not shown). The drag component may contribute as part of the driving force for musical instruments (discussed below). A seminal study by Powell of this phenomenon has exposed many details of the edge tone phenomenon. He showed that this whistle has three stages and the feedback loop was hydrodynamic (Class I). A semi-empirical equation for the frequency, developed by Curle, when converted to Strouhal Number, is
