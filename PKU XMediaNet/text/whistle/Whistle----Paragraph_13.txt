Whistles that generate sound through fluctuations of momentum or a force exerted on the surrounding medium are called dipole-like sources. The figure on the right is example of a small rigid sphere that is moving back and forth in a given direction. If the sphere is small with respect to the wavelength of the sound emitted, it can be called a point dipole. A force must be applied to the sphere in a specific direction to move it. The surrounding medium in the direction of motion is compressed to radiate sound, but the medium at right angles slides past the sphere and is not compressed.
