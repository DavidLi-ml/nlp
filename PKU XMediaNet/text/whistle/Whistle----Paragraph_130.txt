The figure also suggests that there is a lateral component of force which can only be interpreted as a weak radial dipole. Experiments have been performed on the ring tone. The lower figure on the right shows the relationship of frequency to Reynolds number. If the Strouhal number were graphed in lieu of the frequency, it would have shown that contours were reasonably constant similar to those for the hole tone. Close examination of the data in the figure showed a slight negative dependence of Strouhal number on Reynolds number.
