One characteristic of a whistle is that it creates a pure, or nearly pure, tone. There are many ways to create pure tones, but we restrict the descriptions here to what are called aerodynamic whistles. Strictly speaking, they are fluid mechanical whistles since they occur in gases, such as air or steam, as well as in liquids, such as water. The only difference between them is the fluid density and the sound speed.
