Most of the whistles described generate nearly pure tones that can be heard. The mountain tones discussed above are examples of tones that are inaudible because they are below the frequency range of humans. There are others whose sound levels are below the audible range of humans. For example, the vortex street behind a stick underwater might radiate at audible frequencies but not sufficiently to be heard by a Scuba diver. There are others that are both below audible frequencies and below audible levels.
