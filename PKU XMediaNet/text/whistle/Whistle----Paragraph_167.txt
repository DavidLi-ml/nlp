In another study one set of their frequency data was recalculated in terms of Strouhal number and it was found to rise slowly and then be constant over a range of flow rates. Kim found a similar result; the Strouhal number increased with Reynolds number and then stayed constant as shown in the lower figure on the right. Another uniqueness of this whistle is that the feedback is sufficiently strong that the jet is bodily diverted instead of depending on flow instability vortex development to control it. The geometry of the device suggests that it is essentially a dipole source that operates in Stage I with Class I (hydrodynamic) feedback.
