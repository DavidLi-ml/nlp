An interior vortex of this type would explain why no frequency jumps occur. Since the excess fluid in the cavity must be discharged, the jet lateral movement must be considerably larger than that found in the edge tone; this is likely the reason for the high level sound. The flow over the edge results in an applied force and a dipole-like sound field. The characteristic speed must be U the jet exit speed. The characteristic dimension must be D, the cavity diameter.
