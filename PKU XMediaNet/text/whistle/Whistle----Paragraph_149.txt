The cross section of a common whistle is shown in the figure on the right. The cavity is a closed end cylinder (3/4 inch diameter), but with the cylinder axis lateral to the jet axis. The orifice is 1/16 inch wide and the sharp edge is 1/4 inch from the jet orifice. When blown weakly, the sound is mostly broad band with a weak tone. When blown more forcefully, a strong tone is established near 2800 Hz and adjacent bands are at least 20 dB down. If the whistle is blown yet more forcefully, the level of the tone increases and the frequency increases only slightly suggesting Class I hydrodynamic feedback and operation only in Stage I.
