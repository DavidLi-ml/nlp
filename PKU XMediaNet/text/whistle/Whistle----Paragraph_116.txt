An edge tone occurs when a jet impinges on a fixed surface. A trailing edge tone occurs when an exterior flow passes over a trailing edge. There is a whistle that is a combination of an edge tone and a trailing edge tone and might be called a wake-edge tone. It occurs in rotating circular saws under idling conditions and may be called the circular saw whistle. Under load conditions, blade vibration plays a role which is not addressed here.
