Whistles that generate sound through fluctuations of mass flow across a boundary are called monopole-like sources. The figure on the right is an example of a small sphere whose volume is oscillating. Any arbitrary fixed boundary drawn around the sphere will show a net mass flow across it. If the sphere is small enough relative to the sound wavelength it is emitting, it can be called a point monopole. For this type of source, the sound is emitted radially so the sound field is the same in every direction and decays with the inverse square of the distance. Real whistles are only approximations to this idealized model. most have boundaries around them such as the Hole Tone described below. Nevertheless, much can be learned about whistles with the useful form of the sound power equation for the monopole. Using the definitions below, it can be expressed as
