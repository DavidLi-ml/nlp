   The first number is the ratio of unsteady inertial forces to steady inertial forces. The number was named in honor of Vincenz Strouhal who first deduced the relationship between the vortex shedding frequency around a cylinder and the flow speed. The characteristic variables were the cylinder diameter L1, and the speed of the flow over it U. He found the number to be reasonably constant over given a Reynolds number range.
