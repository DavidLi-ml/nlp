Whistles come in all shapes and sizes, but their operation can be unified through the concepts of dynamic and geometric similarity. Nature knows nothing of the specific measurement systems we use; it cares only about ratios between the various forces, time scales, and the several dimensions. To compare them we need to take into account the established ratios that are relevant to whistle operation.
