If dynamic similarity holds for both resonances, the latter equation suggests how organ pipes are scaled. The apparent simplicity of the equation hides important variable factors such as the effective pipe length where δ1 is correction for the open end and δ2 is the correction for the end near the jet. The jet disturbance (vortex) speed from orifice to edge will vary with mean speed U, edge distance h, and slit width d as suggested in the Edge Tone section.
