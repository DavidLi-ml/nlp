  , shows the mean speed U of the jet at the orifice as the characteristic speed and the distance h from orifice to the edge as the characteristic dimension. The integer n represents the various vortex modes. It also suggests that dynamic similarity is achieved to a first approximation; one deviation is that the speed at the wedge, which is less than that at the orifice, should be the characteristic speed. A weak negative Reynolds number effect is likely. The orifice width d also has some influence; it is related to vortex size and lateral correlation of the shedding process.
