Gun-mortars are hybrid weapons, the archetype being the Brandt 60 mm LR Gun-mortar, which combine features of modern infantry mortars together with those of modern cannon. Such weapons are smoothbore, firing fin stabilised rounds, using relatively small propellant charges in comparison to projectile weight, they have short barrels in comparison to guns and are much more lightly built than guns of a similar calibre-all characteristics of infantry mortars. However, they also have gun like features, such as vehicle mountings (or mounting on a gun carriage) together with sighting systems that allows direct fire, breech loading and recuperation; some such as the 2B9 Vasilek are autoloading. This produces a weapon capable of engaging area targets with indirect high angle fire, and also specific targets such as vehicles and bunkers with direct fire. Such hybrids are a lot heavier and more complicated than infantry mortars, superior to rocket propelled grenades in the anti armour and bunker busting role, but have a reduced range compared to modern gun-howitzers and inferior anti-tank capability compared to modern anti tank guided weapons. However, they do have a niche in, for example, providing a multi-role anti-personnel, anti-armour capability in light mobile formations.
