The French developed an improved version of the Stokes mortar as the Brandt Mle 27, further refined as the Brandt Mle 31; this design was widely copied with and without license. About 700 Stokes mortars were acquired by Poland between 1923 and 1926. These weapons were the prototypes for all subsequent light mortar developments around the world.
