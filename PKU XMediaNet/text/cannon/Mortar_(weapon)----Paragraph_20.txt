The mortar is a relatively simple and easy weapon to operate. A modern mortar consists of a tube into which assistant gunners drop a purpose-designed bomb. The tube is generally set at an angle of between 45 and 85 degrees to the ground, with the higher angle giving shorter firing distances. The bomb has a small baseline charge (primary charge) and no cartridge case; for extra range, propellant rings (augmentation charges) are attached to the bomb's fins. When it reaches the base of the tube, the bomb hits a fixed firing pin, which detonates the baseline charge and fires the projectile. Some mortars have a moving firing pin, operated by a lanyard; others may be fired by a trigger.
