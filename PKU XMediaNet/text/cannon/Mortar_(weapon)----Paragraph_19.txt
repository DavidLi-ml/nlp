Well-known incidents using these weapons include the 1985 Newry mortar attack, when nine members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary were killed, and the Downing Street mortar attack in 1991. In the latter, the IRA launched three bombs at 10 Downing Street, the British Prime Minister's residence, during a cabinet meeting there. The only bomb that detonated landed in the building's back garden, and shattered the rear windows. Prime Minister John Major had to move to Admiralty House while repairs were effected.
