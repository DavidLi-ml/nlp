Coehorn-type mortars of approximately 180 pounds (82 kg) weight were used by both sides during the American Civil War. At the Siege of Vicksburg, General US Grant reported making such mortars "by taking logs of the toughest wood that could be found, boring them out for six or twelve-pound shells and binding them with stong iron bands. These answered as coehorns, and shells were successfully thrown from them into the trenches of the enemy."
