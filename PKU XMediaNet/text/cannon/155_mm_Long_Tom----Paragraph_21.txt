The gun was also mounted on a modified M4 medium tank chassis, in mount M13. The resulting vehicle was initially designated 155 mm Gun Motor Carriage T83 and eventually standardized as 155 mm Gun Motor Carriage M40. 155 mm Gun Motor Carriage T79, based on T23 Medium Tank chassis, never advanced past proposal stage. A portable "Panama mount" M1 was also provided.
