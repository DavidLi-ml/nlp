Anti-fans usually specify the fandom they are opposed to within their name, e.g. Anti-Twilight fans. It is common for large anti-fandoms to gather in groups, usually on forums and sites, to share their mutual aversion. These are coined anti-fan clubs, and some are substantial enough to become anti-fan sites.
