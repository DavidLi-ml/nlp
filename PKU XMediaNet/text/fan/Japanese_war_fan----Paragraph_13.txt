In the manga/anime series Naruto, Temari wields a giant iron fan that can create powerful gusts of wind capable of leveling the surrounding landscape. Two of the series main antagonist Obito Uchiha and Madara Uchiha both wield a Gunbai known as Gunbai Uchiwa (軍配団扇, Gunbai Uchiwa, Literally meaning: army arrangement fan) is a non-folding fan, carved from a unique spirit tree from which only ritualistic instruments are made. This Gunbai has been passed down between Uchiha clansmen for generations. Madara Uchiha was known for having great expertise in using it. In addition the symbol of the Uchiha Clan is a fan which is a reference to uchiwa (団扇, paper fan) which is another way of pronouncing the clan's name.
