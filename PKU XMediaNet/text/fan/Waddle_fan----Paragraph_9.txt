Later fans, post WWI, began to be driven by electric motors instead. These ran at higher speeds and so the large diameter fan was unsuitable, as its high linear air velocity at the rim led to turbulence and mechanical vibration. These fans began to be used as pairs of smaller fans (typically 17 ft) instead, although the Waddle design was basically unsuitable here, leading to its eventual demise.
