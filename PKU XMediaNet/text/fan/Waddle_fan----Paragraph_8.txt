The first fans were of simple design. An 1890 fan at Morton Colliery, Derbyshire, had a shallow conical impeller of 40 ft diameter and 1ft 6in width at the rim. The internal blades were of extremely curved form. Its construction is simple, of flat wrought iron plates, joined by rivets and angle iron. Working at 45rpm, the fan moved 70,000 cubic feet of air per minute. Within a few years, the aerodynamics of the impeller had developed so that their operating speed and efficiency had increased substantially. An 1896 fan at Chanters Colliery, Tyldesley, Lancashire, was of the same overall dimensions and speed, but moved 150,000 cu ft / minute. The improvements of these later fans were the use of an outwardly flanged, curved évasée rim that gave smoother airflow at the rim and also straighter internal blades, for the higher speed fans.
