In the possible event of a fire, an operating attic fan could, in theory, spread the flames because of the air movement. To reduce the danger, louvered vents that allow air to pass through can incorporate fusible links so that fire will melt the links in which case the vent will automatically close. In addition, an automatic cutoff switch can be set up to turn off power to the fan if it detects a temperature above a preset limit.
