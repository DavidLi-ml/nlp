Attic fans may be wired several different ways. Usually the fan is hardwired directly into an electric circuit, and is controlled by a thermostat most commonly ranging from 60 째F (16 째C) to 120 째F (49 째C). It may also be hardwired but controlled by a switch. Another popular method is to have the fan plugged into an electric socket mounted nearby. An environmentally friendly method is to wire a specialized fan to a roof-mounted solar panel.
