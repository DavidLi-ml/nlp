Used to aerate the case of the computer. The components inside the case cannot dissipate heat efficiently if the surrounding air is too hot. Case fans move air through the case, usually drawing cooler outside air in through the front or bottom (where it may also be drawn over the internal hard drive racks) and expelling it through the top or rear. Some ATX tower cases have one or more vents and mounting points in the left side panel where one or more fans may be installed to blow cool air directly onto the motherboard components and expansions cards, which are ones of the largest heat sources.
