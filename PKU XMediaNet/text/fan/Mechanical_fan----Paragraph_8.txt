With the advent of practical steam power, fans could finally be used for ventilation. David Boswell Reid, a Scottish physician, installed four steam powered fans in the ceiling of St George's Hospital in Liverpool, so that the pressure produced by the fans would force the incoming air upward and through vents in the ceiling. In 1849 a 6 m radius steam driven fan, designed by William Brunton, was made operational in the Gelly Gaer Colliery of South Wales. The model was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Improvements in the technology were made by James Nasmyth, Frenchman Theophile Guibal and J. R. Waddle.
