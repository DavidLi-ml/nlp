Forward-curve â€“ This "squirrel cage" impeller generates the highest volume flow rate (for a given tip speed) of all the centrifugal fans. Therefore, it often has the advantage of offering the smallest physical package available for a given application. This type of fan is commonly used in high-temperature furnaces. However, these fans can only be used for conveying air with low dust loading because they are the most sensitive to particle build-up, but also due to the large number of blades that forward-curve wheels require.
