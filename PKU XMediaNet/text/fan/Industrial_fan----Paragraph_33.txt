Variable pitch on-the-fly axial fans – These are similar to “Variable Pitch Axial Fans” except they include an internal mechanism that allows the blade pitch to be adjusted while the fan rotor is in motion. These versatile fans offer high-efficiency operation at many different points of operation. This instantaneous blade adjustment capability is an advantage that is possible with axial fans only.
