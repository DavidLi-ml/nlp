Radial tipped â€“ These fans have wheels that are backward curved, but in a way slightly different from backward curved fans. Backward curved fans' have wheels whose blades curve outward, while radial-tip fans' blades are curved inward and radial at their tips (hence the name "radial tip"), while still in a backwardly-curved configuration. Their curvature can also be thought of as radial at the tips but gradually sloping toward the direction of rotation. This rugged design is used in high-volume flow rate applications when the pressure requirement is rather high and erosion resistance is necessary. It offers medium efficiencies. A common application is the dirty side of a baghouse or precipitator. The design is more compact than airfoil, backward curved or backward inclined fans.
