Industrial fans and blowers are machines whose primary function is to provide and accommodate a large flow of air or gas to various processes of many industries. This is achieved by rotating a number of blades, connected to a hub and shaft, and driven by a motor or turbine. The flow rates of these fans range from approximately 200 to 2,000,000 cubic feet (5.7 to 57000 cubic meters) per minute. A blower is another name for a fan that operates where the resistance to the flow is primarily on the downstream side of the fan.
