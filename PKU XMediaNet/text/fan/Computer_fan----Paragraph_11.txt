Hard disk fan â€“  a fan mounted next to or onto a hard disk drive, for example when a hard disk drive is mounted in a 5.25-inch drive bay. This may be desirable on faster-spinning hard disks with greater heat production. As of 2011 less expensive drives rotated at speeds up to 7,200 RPM; 10,000 and 15,000 RPM drives were available but generated more heat.
