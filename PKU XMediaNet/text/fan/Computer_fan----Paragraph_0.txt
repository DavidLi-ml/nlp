A computer fan is any fan inside, or attached to, a computer case used for active cooling, and may refer to fans that draw cooler air into the case from the outside, expel warm air from inside, or move air across a heat sink to cool a particular component. Generally these are found in axial and sometimes centrifugal forms. The former is sometimes called a "muffin" fan, while the latter may be called a "biscuit blower" in some product literature.
