Most fans used in computers are of the axial-flow type; centrifugal and crossflow fans are sometimes used. Two important functional specifications are the airflow that can be moved, typically stated in cubic feet per minute (CFM), and static pressure. Given in decibels, the sound volume figure can be also very important for home and office computers; larger fans are generally quieter for the same CFM.
