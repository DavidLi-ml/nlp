A sports fan dedicated to cheering against a specific team can be considered an anti-fan as well. An "Anti-Fan" is said to cheer for whomever the opponent of their team is playing. In the United States, this happens often in college sports, as most colleges have defined or traditional rivals. This concept was noted in a set of ESPN commercials tagged "Never Graduate" and "Long Live Rivalry", where graduates of popular colleges interact with graduates of rival schools in humorous agitating ways.
