In 1998, Walter K. Boyd invented the HVLS ceiling fan. It was a slow moving fan with an eight foot diameter. Due to its size, the fan moved a large column of air and continuously mixed fresh air with the stale air inside. They are used in many industrial and agricultural settings, because of their energy efficiency.
