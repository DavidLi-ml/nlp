The axial design uses axial forces to achieve the movement of the air or gas, spinning a central hub with blades extending radially from its outer diameter. The fluid is moved parallel to the fan wheel's shaft, or axis of rotation. The axial fan wheel is often contained within a short section of cylindrical ductwork, to which inlet and outlet ducting can be connected.
