Cooling fans - (also referred to as "cooling tower fans") - These are axial fans, typically with large diameters, for low pressures and large volumes of airflow. Applications are in wet mechanical cooling towers, air-cooled steam condensers, air-cooled heat exchangers, radiators, or similar air-cooled applications.
