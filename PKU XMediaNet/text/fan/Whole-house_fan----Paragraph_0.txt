A whole-house fan is a type of fan, or exhaust system commonly venting into a building's attic, designed to circulate air in a home or building. It is sometimes confused with a powered attic ventilator, which exhausts hot air from the attic to the outside through an opening in the roof or gable at a low velocity.
