Computer scoring was introduced to the Olympics in 1992. Each of the five judges has a keypad with a red and a blue button. The judges must press a button for which ever corner they feel lands a scoring blow. Previously, three out of the five judges had to press the button for the same boxer within a one-second window in order for the point to score. A legal scoring blow is that which is landed cleanly with the knuckle surface of the glove, within the scoring area (middle of the head, down the sides and between the hips through the belly button), and the boxer can't be committing a foul (slapping, ducking head, wrestling, holding, etc.). As long as the punches land within the scoring area, they are legal and that includes body punches, as well as those to the face.
