Boxing gloves are cushioned gloves that fighters wear on their hands during boxing matches and practices. Unlike the ancient cestus which were designed as a weapon, modern boxing gloves are designed to protect the fighter's hand during a bout, though competitions, sparring and other forms of training have their own specialized gloves. Modern boxing gloves reduce superficial facial injuries; however, as modern boxing gloves give their user the ability to throw stronger punches to head without damaging the hands, they also increase the risk of brain damage for participants.
