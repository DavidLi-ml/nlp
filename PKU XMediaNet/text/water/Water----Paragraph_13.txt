At 4181.3 J/(kgÂ·K), water has a high specific heat capacity, as well as a high heat of vaporization (2257 kJ/kg), both of which are a result of the extensive hydrogen bonding between its molecules. These two unusual properties allow water to moderate Earth's climate by buffering large fluctuations in temperature.
