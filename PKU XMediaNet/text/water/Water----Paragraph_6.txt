Water is a liquid at standard temperature and pressure of 273.15 K (0 °C, 32 °F) and an absolute pressure of exactly 100 000 Pa (1 bar, 14.5 psi, 0.98692 atm). It is tasteless and odorless. The intrinsic color of water and ice is a very slight blue hue, although both appear colorless in small quantities. Water vapour is essentially invisible as a gas.
