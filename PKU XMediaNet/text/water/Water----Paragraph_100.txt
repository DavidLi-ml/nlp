Solutes such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as air pressure, which is in turn is affected by altitude. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One mole of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by 0.51 째C (0.918 째F), and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by 1.02 째C (1.836 째F); similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.
