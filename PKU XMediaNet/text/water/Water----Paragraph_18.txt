Liquid water can be split by the addition of energy equal to the heat of formation of water in the amount of 285.8 kJ/mol (15.9 MJ/kg). Electrolysis of water is a commonly used method of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. The energy required to split water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis or any other means is greater than the energy that can be collected when the hydrogen and oxygen recombine.
