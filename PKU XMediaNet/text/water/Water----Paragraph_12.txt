The boiling point of water (and all other liquids) is dependent on the ambient pressure. For example, on the top of Mount Everest water boils at 68 째C (154 째F), compared to 100 째C (212 째F) at sea level at a similar latitude (since latitude modifies atmospheric pressure slightly). Conversely, water deep in the ocean near geothermal vents can reach temperatures of hundreds of degrees and remain liquid.
