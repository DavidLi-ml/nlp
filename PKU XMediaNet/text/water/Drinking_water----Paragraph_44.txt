On June 24, 2013, researchers from Duke University reported detecting methane in drinking water in Pennsylvania and claim "serious contamination from bubbly methane is 'much more' prevalent in some water wells within 1 kilometer of gas drilling sites". The researchers noted that methane levels were "an average of six times" higher and ethane levels were "23 times higher" in the water wells "closer to drilling sites, compared with those farther away.". On the other hand, the New York Times reported in June 2015 that a landmark U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report on the impact of hydraulic fracking "found no evidence that the contentious technique of oil and gas extraction has had a widespread effect on the nation's water supply."
