Medieval debate poetry was popular in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and this poem draws on their structure, mimicking legal suits of the time. Each bird charges the other with an accusation, and brings forth evidence to support her claim. Proverbs are cited as a rhetorical argument from authority. However, the birds’ rhetorical techniques are highly flawed. The birds’ attack strategies rely on belittlement, condescension, and analogizing their opponent’s habits to unsavory people or things.
