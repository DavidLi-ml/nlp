It is equally difficult to establish an exact date when The Owl and the Nightingale was first written. The two surviving manuscripts are thought to be copied from one exemplar, and they are dated to the second half of the 13th century. In ll. 1091-2, the nightingale prays for the soul of "king Henri", which is thought to reference “either the death of Henry II of England in 1189 or of Henry III of England in 1272". Scholars see no evidence that the poem predates the surviving manuscripts by many years. It is possible that the poem was written in the 12th or 13th century, and “there is a serious possibility the poem was composed after the death of Henry III in 1272”.
