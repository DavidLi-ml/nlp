The opera, the first act written in 1908 and the later two in 1913-14, was the first ever to be written by Stravinsky. The delay between writing the first and the latter acts was caused by his commissions to write The Firebird, Petrushka, and The Rite of Spring for impresario Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. After this lapse of time, during which Stravinsky established himself as a ballet composer, he was unsure of returning to Le rossignol, and although he did finish it, he chose to also create a purely symphonic version, Le chant du rossignol.
