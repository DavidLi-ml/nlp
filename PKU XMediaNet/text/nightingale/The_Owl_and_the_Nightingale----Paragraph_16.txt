The poem’s language is not superfluously dense or grandiloquent. The birds’ dialogue is colloquial, and their insults are scathing. The analogies employed are also rural, equating the Nightingale’s song to the barbarous speech of an Irish priest, 'Þu chatereƒt ƒo doÞ on yris preƒt' [ 322] referring to fox hunts, and commenting on the use and practicality of scarecrows.
