The pieceâ€™s ballet debut occurred on February 2, 1920 at the Theatre National de l'Opera in Paris. The choreography was Leonid Massine by and designs by Henri Matisse. This also was met with some skepticism. Stravinsky himself was not entirely pleased. "I had destined Le Chant du Rossignol for the concert platform, and a choreographic rendering seemed to me to be quite unnecessary," he says later in his autobiography.
