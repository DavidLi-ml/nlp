Stravinsky was always specific about the use of movement with music. He once said, "I do not see how one can be a choreographer unless, like Balanchine, one is a musician first," in praise of the famous choreographer who began working with Stravinsky for the revival of Le Chant du rossignol. Balanchine was in fact a musician himself, and already a fan of Stravinskyâ€™s work. He was immediately willing to take the challenge. "I learned the music well, and so ... when Diaghilev asked me to stage Stravinsky's ballet Le Chant du rossignol, I was able to do it quickly," Balanchine is quoted as saying.
