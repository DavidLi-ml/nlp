Buttons were graded by quality. The finest export grade were mounted onto pink cards. Domestic quality were set on dark blue cards and the lowest quality onto yellow cards. A good buttoner could make around six dozen (72) buttons a day and could earn up to 3 shillings. Buttons sold at retail for between eight pence and three shillings a dozen. This compared to wages of perhaps 9d a day as a farm worker. It also had the advantage of being a home-based activity, which was more attractive than being outside in all weathers and also reduced expenditure on shoes, wear and laundry on clothes.
