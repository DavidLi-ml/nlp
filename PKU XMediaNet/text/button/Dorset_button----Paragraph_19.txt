After a fire in 1731 destroyed the Bere depot Elias Case, Abraham's son, employed a Yorkshire businessman John Clayton as a manager, who reorganised the firm. A London sales office was opened by Clayton in 1743, followed in 1744 by a new major depot at Lytchett Minster. Abraham's grandson Peter Case opened an export office in Liverpool. Case family money founded the well-known Cases Street and Clayton Square in Liverpool. Peter Case also developed a new rust-free alloy for making the wire rings.
