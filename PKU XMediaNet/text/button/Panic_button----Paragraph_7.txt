A button used in convenience stores, gas station, or other establishments staffed with a single employee during late hours. Often located under the counter near the cash register or safe, the button can be pressed in times of distress (Such as robbery, disruptive or threatening behavior, or a situation which may warrant assistance), triggering a silent alarm. If the button alarms a private security company, a fee may be charged for each time the button is used. This prevents misuse, and often aids in the employees judgment of the situation; whether or not it warrants the fee to have help to deal with the situation.
