A device given to elderly individuals in order to maintain their independence outside of an Aged Care Facility, while still affording them a means of summoning help should they require it (i.e. a medical emergency that renders them immobile, like a fall, injury or illness). Such a device can also be referred to as an Emergency Medical Alert (EMA) button and can be fitted as either a pendant or bracelet to be worn by the user. MAB's are usually wireless connected to a call center. When the alarm is raised, an operator will call the individual's home to ensure a false alarm has not occurred; if there is no answer, the operator will alert either family members, emergency services, or both.
