By the end of the 17th century, Buttony had grown to become an important industry, controlled within the Case family. A great many peddlers and hawkers were registered in Shaftesbury, far more than in any other local towns. An Act of Parliament was passed in 1699 that, amongst its export restrictions on woolens, prevented the making of buttons “made of cloth, serge, drugget, or other stuffs”. The Act would remain in force for two hundred years, but in practice appears to have little lasting effect on trade.
