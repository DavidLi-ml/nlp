Linen yarns and fabric were used for quality and commercial work, although some early buttons for local use used cheaper woolen yarns from local herds. Most buttons were produced in their natural colour, but could be dyed to match garments. The use of multiple yarn colours is a predominantly modern trend. Dorset buttons were known and traded widely, but it was a long time before there was a recognisable industry to them.
