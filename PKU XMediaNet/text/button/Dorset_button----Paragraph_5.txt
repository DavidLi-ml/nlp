Crosswise strands are stitched radially across the button, from side to side of the casting stitches. Stitches are either caught through the casting stitches, now on the inside after slicking, or else they are simply wrapped over the outside of the ring. These passes may form either a radial star or, if they pass to the sides of the centre, a hollow star. The number of strands varies for the pattern. Strands are usually arranged symmetrically around the ring, but they may be skipped or gathered into bunches, to give patterns.
