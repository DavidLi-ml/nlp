In the UK, casement windows were the most common house window before the sash window was introduced, and usually contained leaded glassâ€”glass panes held in place with strips of lead (called lead "cames"; leaded glass is not to be confused with lead glass, which refers to the manufacture of the glass itself). These casement windows usually were hinged on the side, and opened inward. The windows were covered by functional exterior shutters, which opened outward. Variants of casement windows are still the norm in many European countries, such as Denmark and Sweden.
