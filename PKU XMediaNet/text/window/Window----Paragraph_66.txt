National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC), a non-profit organization, administers an independent, uniform rating and labeling system for the energy performance of fenestration products. NFRC is the "engine" that drives virtually every window energy efficiency program in the country including ENERGY STAR (the U.S Government Sponsored Initiative).
