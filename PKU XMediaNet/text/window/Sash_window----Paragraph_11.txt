In recent years, uPVC sash windows have become available. These are sold as offering advantages over timber windows, but these advantages are illusory. uPVC, particularly when exposed, has a limited life and does not lend itself to repairs. In addition, profiles of frames and sashes vary from company to company and from year to year, and as a result windows can need replacing in their entirety after as little as 20 years.
