Modern double-glazed sash windows are now available, but depending on their aesthetic style, can be frowned upon. Traditionally styled double-glazed sash windows will often attempt to mimic the original appearance through the use of non-functional muntins or "glazing bars", which are applied to the surface of the glazing, and give the appearance that the sash is made up of several smaller panes, whereas in reality, each sash consists of only one large double-glazed unit.
