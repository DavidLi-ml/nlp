The glass in old windows can be as important as the sashes themselves, varying from very early 'plate' or 'broad' glass to 'crown' or 'cylinder'. Old glass is easily recognised by its imperfections ('ream') which give a degree of distortion both when looking through it and when looking at it from the outside. Of these, the only glass still currently being manufactured in the traditional way is cylinder. All other old glass is therefore irreplaceable and should be carefully conserved and/or protected before any work is carried out.
