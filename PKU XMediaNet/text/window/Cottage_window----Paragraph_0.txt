A cottage window is a double-hung window — i.e., a window with two sashes sliding up and down, hung with one atop the other in the same frame — in which the upper sash is smaller (shorter) than the lower one. The upper sash pane is often decorated with a divided light pattern, or grille, although in some cases both sashes may be divided.
