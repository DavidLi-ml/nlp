An additional advantage of jalousie windows is the ability to leave them at least partway open in most heavy rains, maintaining desirable ventilation whether a sun shower or prolonged tropical storm. On the downside, traditional style louvered windows offer poor overall resistance to water penetration and drafts. They also are difficult to positively secure, as their slats are easily and silently removed.
