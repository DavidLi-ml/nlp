Most medieval bay windows and up to the baroque era are oriel windows. They frequently appear as a highly ornamented addition to the building rather than an organic part of it. Particularly during the Gothic period they frequently contain small house chapels, with the oriel window containing an altar and resembling an apse of a church. Especially in Nuremberg these are even called Ch√∂rlein (meaning Little Apse or Little Choir) with the most famous example being the one from the parsonage of St. Sebaldus Church.
