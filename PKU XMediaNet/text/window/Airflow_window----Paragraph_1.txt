In warm climates the window is used for exhausting ventilation air. Cooler air enters the cavity at the bottom, from the interior space, is heated during transfer upwards through the cavity and is exhausted at the top of the cavity to the exterior. In cold climates the window is used for intake of ventilation air. Cold air enters the bottom of the cavity, from the outside, is heated during transfer upwards though the cavity, and enters the interior space at the top of the cavity. More complex designs exist, which for example do not transfer ventilated air between the interior and exterior, or which have multiple ventilation channels.
