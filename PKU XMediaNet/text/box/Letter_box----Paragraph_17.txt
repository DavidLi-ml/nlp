External or curbside letter boxes are not temperature-controlled and can sometimes be a concern for temperature-sensitive products such as pharmaceuticals. Conditions can include high and low temperatures outside of the recommended storage conditions for certain products. For example, the US found the temperature in a steel mailbox painted black could reach 136 째F (58 째C) in full sun while the ambient air temperature was 101 째F (38 째C).
