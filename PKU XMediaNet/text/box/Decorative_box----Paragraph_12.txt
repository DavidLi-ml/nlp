Modern snuff boxes are made from a variety of woods, pewter and even plastic and are manufactured in surprising numbers due, largely, to snuff's resurgence amongst tobacco connoisseurs and ex-smokers. This has been driven by online special interest sites such as Snuffhouse.org and a new generation of internet based retailers. New silver snuff boxes are still marketed by the companies Ari. D. Norman and Regnas.
