An open litter pan is generally the most basic and least expensive design. They are commonly constructed out of plastic, however some disposable models exist, in the shape of a rectangular tray with outwardly sloped sides 10 to 15 centimeters (3.9 to 5.9 inches) high. Open litter pans allow for maximum ventilation which may increase cat comfort. Also, they show the waste most visibly which may encourage owners to scoop the box more frequently. Litter pans with low walls may not contain litter when a pet scratches or digs, some animals who eliminate standing up may be able to urinate/defecate over the walls. Some designs include a detachable rim to help catch litter when the animal kicks to bury their waste.
