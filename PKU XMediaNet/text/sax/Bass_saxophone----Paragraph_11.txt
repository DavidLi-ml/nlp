It is rarely used in orchestral music, though several examples exist. The earliest extant work to employ it is William Henry Fry's "sacred symphony" Hagar In the Wilderness (1853), which also calls for soprano saxophone and was written for Louis-Antoine Jullien's orchestra during its American tour. It was also used by Richard Strauss in his Sinfonia Domestica, where included in the music are parts for four saxophones including a bass saxophone in C. Arnold Schoenberg wrote for the bass sax in his one-act opera Von Heute auf Morgen ("Of Today and Tomorrow").
