While not as popular as the alto and tenor saxes in jazz, the soprano saxophone has played a role in the evolution of that music. Greats of the jazz soprano sax include 1930s virtuoso Sidney Bechet, 1950s innovator Steve Lacy, and, beginning with his landmark 1960 album My Favorite Things, John Coltrane.
