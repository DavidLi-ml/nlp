The baritone saxophone’s relatively large mass (15 to 35 pounds or 6.8 to 15.9 kilograms depending in large part on the horn’s age) has led to the development of harness-style neckstrap that distributes the instrument's weight across the user's shoulders. Several different kinds exist, produced by brands as well-known as Neotech and Vandoren, and each distributes weight differently across the saxophonist’s neck, clavicle, and shoulder blades. Many marching saxophonists prefer this style for its ability to decrease fatigue. Those who mainly perform seated, on the other hand, may dislike the decreased ability to move one’s upper body.
