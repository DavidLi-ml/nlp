The sopranissimo or soprillo saxophone is the smallest member of the saxophone family. It is pitched in B♭, one octave above the soprano saxophone. Because of the difficulties in building such a small instrument—the soprillo is 30 cm (12 in) long, 33 cm (13 in) with the mouthpiece—it is only recently that a true sopranissimo saxophone has been produced. The keywork only extends to a written high E♭ (rather than F, F♯, or sometimes G, like most saxophones) and the upper octave key has to be placed in the mouthpiece.
