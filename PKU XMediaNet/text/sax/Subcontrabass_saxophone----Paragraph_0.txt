The subcontrabass saxophone is a type of saxophone that Adolphe Sax patented and planned to build but never constructed. Sax called this imagined instrument saxophone bourdon (named after the lowest stop on the pipe organ). It is a transposing instrument pitched in Bâ™­, one octave below the bass saxophone, two octaves below the tenor saxophone, and three octaves and a major second below its written pitch.
