The alto saxophone, also referred to as the alto sax, is a member of the saxophone family of woodwind instruments invented by Belgian instrument designer Adolphe Sax in the 1840s, and patented in 1846. It is smaller than the tenor but larger than the soprano. The alto and tenor are the most common types of saxophones. The alto sax is the most common saxophone and is commonly used in classical music (such as concert bands, chamber music, and solo repertoire), military bands, marching bands, and jazz (such as big bands, jazz combos, swing music). The saxophone fingerings are all universal, so a saxophone player can play any type of saxophone.
