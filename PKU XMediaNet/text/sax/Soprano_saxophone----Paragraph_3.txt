In addition to straight sopranos, there are also slightly and fully curved sopranos. The fully curved variety looks much like a small alto saxophone with a straighter crook. There is some debate over the effect of the straight and curved neck, with some players believing that a curved neck on a soprano gives it a warmer, less nasal tone. The soprano has all the keys of other saxophone models (with the exception of the extra 'A' on some baritones) and some (e.g. those made by Yanagisawa, Selmer, and Yamaha) may have a top 'G' key next to the F-sharp key.
