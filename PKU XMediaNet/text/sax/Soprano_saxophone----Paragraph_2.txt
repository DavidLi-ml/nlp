The soprano saxophone can be compared to the Bâ™­ clarinet. Although the clarinet can play a diminished fifth lower and over a fifth higher, the sax produces stronger high notes. Due to the smaller bore of the soprano, it is less forgiving with respect to intonation, though an experienced player will use alternate fingerings or vary breath support, tongue position or embouchure to compensate. Professional players will use the technique of voicing to fix problems with intonation. Due to its similarity in tone to the oboe, the soprano saxophone is sometimes used as a substitute for it.
