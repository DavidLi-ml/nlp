Baritone saxophones come in two sizes with one ranging to low A and the other to low B♭. Originally, all baritone saxophones were low B♭ instruments, but over time players began modifying their horns to reach the low A below. In the 1980s, it became common for saxophone manufacturers to produce low A instruments. In modern times, the low A is considered standard and is often written in sheet music for the instrument. Despite the ubiquity of the low A horn, some players still prefer to use B♭ horns because of the added weight and supposedly poorer tone quality of low A horns. As is true for other saxophones, the F♯ key was also a later addition to the horn now considered standard.
