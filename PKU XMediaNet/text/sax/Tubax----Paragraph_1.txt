The tubax has had debate over whether it is really in the saxophone family. Its bore is not as wide as other saxophones that size are, and the tubing is very thin compared to other saxes. Some authorities classify it as its own family of instruments, while others consider it in the saxophone family. Also, the tubax is a lot like a double reed instrument family called a sarrusophone. The sarrusophone's range is the same as a saxophone, while some have a high G, though the tubax has a much wider bore compared to the latter instrument. Lastly, the tubax's sound is a little bit "honkier" than the average saxophone.
