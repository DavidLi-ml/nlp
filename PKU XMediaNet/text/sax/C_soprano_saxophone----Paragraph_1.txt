In the early 20th century, the C soprano was marketed to those who wished to perform oboe parts in military band, vaudeville arrangements, or church hymnals. C sopranos are the same shape as Bâ™­ sopranos and differ in length by only around 3 centimeters. C soprano saxophones usually have a "C" stamped on them, close to the serial number. The same companies that made C melody instruments manufactured C soprano saxophones (e.g. Conn). As with C melody instruments, production of C sopranos commenced circa 1919 and ended around 1929. Currently, AquilaSax makes C soprano saxophones.
