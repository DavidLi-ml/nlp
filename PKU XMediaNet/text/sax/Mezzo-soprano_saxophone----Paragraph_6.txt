On January 28, 2012, Aquilasax of New Zealand (known for producing modern C melody and C soprano saxophones) announced on their Facebook page (search "Aquilasax Face" on Facebook) that they would consider developing a revival of the F Mezzo-Soprano saxophone if enough customer interest was demonstrated. Aquilasax added a page on their online store for potential buyers to place their names on a waiting list, saying that they would consider proceeding with development of the horn if there was enough response to justify development costs. The listed price of the Aquilasax F-Mezzo-Soprano saxophone, if produced, is $2950.
