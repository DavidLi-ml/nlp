The mezzo-soprano is the only saxophone pitched in F, apart from a few prototypes of an F baritone saxophone. (Although Maurice Ravel's 1928 orchestral work Bol√©ro calls for a sopranino saxophone in F, it is unlikely that such an instrument ever existed; nowadays the sopranino saxophone part is usually played on a soprano saxophone).
