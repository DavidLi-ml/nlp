The saxophone was subsequently introduced into the concert bands, which generally call for an E♭ alto saxophone, a B♭ tenor saxophone, and an E♭ baritone saxophone. A typical high-level concert band includes two altos, one tenor, and one baritone. A B♭ soprano saxophone is also occasionally used, in which case it is normally played by the first alto saxophonist. A bass saxophone in B♭ is called for in some concert band music (especially music by Percy Grainger).
