A New Zealand company called Aquilasax announced plans in 2006 to begin producing a new "C melody tenor saxophone" in 2007. A prototype has been built, and production has now started. There were quality control and packaging problems with the first batch, apparently these problems are now solved and will not occur again. The second batch was to be available in December, however these had intonation problems found to be related to the construction of the necks (both straight and curved). Latest word from the source as of June 30, 2008: “I am relieved to announce the arrival of new stock of New C saxes. I was beginning to think the resurrection was a myth. Once again I will be working through checking each one and will email customers when the finish option of their choice is ready to ship.”
