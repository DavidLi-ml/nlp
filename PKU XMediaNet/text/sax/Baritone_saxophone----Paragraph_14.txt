A few modern non-jazz artists have recently begun to incorporate saxophones into their instrumentation. The LA Indie rock band Fitz and the Tantrums featured both an alto and a baritone saxophone in their music -- most recently their 2016 song "Handclap" from an album of the same name. Both were played by band member James King. The "Brasshouse" (experimental jazz/funk) group Too Many Zooz is another group that has popularized the baritone horn. Originally a New York City subway band, the trio has released three albums and been featured on a TEDx Budapest segment.
