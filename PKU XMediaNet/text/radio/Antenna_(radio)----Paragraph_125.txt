For very low frequencies to high frequencies (<30 MHz), the ground behaves as a lossy dielectric, Thus the ground is characterized both by a conductivity  and permittivity (dielectric constant) which can be measured for a given soil (but is influenced by fluctuating moisture levels) or can be estimated from certain maps. At lower frequencies the ground acts mainly as a good conductor, which AM middle wave broadcast (.5 - 1.6 MHz) antennas depend on.
