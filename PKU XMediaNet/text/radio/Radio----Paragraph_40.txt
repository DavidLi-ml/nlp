Marine voice radios can use single sideband voice (SSB) in the shortwave High Frequency (HFâ€”3 MHz to 30 MHz) radio spectrum for very long ranges or Marine VHF radio / narrowband FM in the VHF spectrum for much shorter ranges. Narrowband FM sacrifices fidelity to make more channels available within the radio spectrum, by using a smaller range of radio frequencies, usually with five kHz of deviation, versus the 75 kHz used by commercial FM broadcasts, and 25 kHz used for TV sound.
