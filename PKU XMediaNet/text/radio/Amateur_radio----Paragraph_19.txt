All countries that license citizens to use amateur radio require operators to display knowledge and understanding of key concepts, usually by passing an exam; however, some authorities also recognize certain educational or professional qualifications (such as a degree in electrical engineering) in lieu thereof. The licenses grant hams the privilege to operate in larger segments of the radio frequency spectrum, with a wider variety of communication techniques, and with higher power levels relative to unlicensed personal radio services (such as CB radio, FRS, and PMR446), which require type-approved equipment restricted in mode, range, and power.
