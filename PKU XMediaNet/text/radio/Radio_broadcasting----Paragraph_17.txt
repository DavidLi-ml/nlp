AM broadcasts occur on North American airwaves in the medium wave frequency range of 530 to 1700 kHz (known as the “standard broadcast band”). The band was expanded in the 1990s by adding nine channels from 1620 to 1700 kHz. Channels are spaced every 10 kHz in the Americas, and generally every 9 kHz everywhere else.
