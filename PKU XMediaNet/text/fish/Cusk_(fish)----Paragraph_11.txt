Cusk is a US National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern. Species of Concern are those species about which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the Endangered Species Act(ESA). On March 9, 2007 the National Marine Fisheries Service announced the initiation of a status review to determine whether the species warrants listing under the ESA.
