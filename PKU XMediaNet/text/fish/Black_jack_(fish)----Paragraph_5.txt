The black jack is a benthopelagic species rarely found in shallow inshore waters, preferring deep, clear offshore waters of depths from 12 to 354 m. The species is most common in insular oceanic habitats and around offshore islands, rarely found close to the continents. The black jack inhabits deep reefs and reef drop offs, also being common around oceanic seamounts. It has been recorded from lagoons in the Solomon Islands.
