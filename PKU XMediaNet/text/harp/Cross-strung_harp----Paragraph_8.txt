The most common type of contemporary cross-strung harp is strung with nylon, and is built with a "7x5" string configuration: each octave contains the seven notes of a diatonic scale on one set of strings, and the five "accidentals" per octave on the other set of strings. The layout is similar to that of a keyboard. Like a keyboard, each major scale has its own fingering pattern, and basic chords fall into pattern shapes or groupings. The advantage of this layout is that it provides a familiar concept (diatonic and accidentals) to the player, and is easier to learn, owing to the presence of the diatonic "home row" of strings.
