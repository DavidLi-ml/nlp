Three of the four oldest authentic harps to survive are of Gaelic provenance: the Trinity College Harp preserved in Trinity College Dublin, and the Queen Mary Harp and the Lamont Harp in the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh. The last two are examples of the small low-headed harp, and are both made from hornbeam, a wood not native to Scotland. All three are dated approximately to the 15th century and may have been made in Argyll in western Scotland. Many “Irish” harps from later periods have no provenance and could possibly be of Scottish origin.
