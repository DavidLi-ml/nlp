Contemporary cross-strung harps are being built with gut, nylon or wire strings, in a variety of sizes ranging from two to five or more octaves. Unlike the Spanish or French cross-strung harps, these are designed on a Celtic or folk harp model with smaller soundboxes, lighter string tension, and smaller size.
