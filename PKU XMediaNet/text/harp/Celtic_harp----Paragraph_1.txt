The early history of the triangular frame harp in Europe is contested. The first instrument associated with the harping tradition in the Gaelic world was known as a cruit. This word may originally have described a different stringed instrument, being etymologically related to the Welsh crwth. It has been suggested that the word clàrsach/cláirseach (from clàr/clár, a board) was coined for the triangular frame harp which replaced the cruit, and that this coining was of Scottish origin.
