The Lyon and Healy electric and electro-acoustic harps are built first on the quality of the traditional Lyon and Healy harp. In the development of the initial electric harp, there was an effort to mimic the acoustic sound. While this sound may not be ideal (from a frequency standpoint), it is the sound that most characterizes what the classically trained harpist hears and expects. It was assumed that the sound would come from the individual transducers and the string, with minimal influence of the sounding board. Therefore, the board was thickened to provide less resonance and less interference of pedal noise. The sound was better than using traditional on-board microphones, but, again, not ideal for all settings. Following much input from performers, Lyon and Healy, with the assistance of Susan Mazer and several other harpists including Greg Buchanan and Harvi Griffin, developed the electro-acoustic harp, which retained the thin resonant sounding board, playable acoustically, with individual transducers that would necessarily integrate all vibrations from the board and the string. This combination provides the best sonority and, when amplified through a full-frequency sound system, is the warmest.
