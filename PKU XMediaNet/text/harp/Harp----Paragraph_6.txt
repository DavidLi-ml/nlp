The harp was popular in ancient China and neighboring regions, though harps are largely extinct in East Asia in the modern day. The Chinese konghou harp is documented as early as the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 B.C.), and became extinct during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). A similar harp, the gonghu was played in ancient Korea, documented as early as the Goguryeo period (37 B.C. - 686 A.D.).
