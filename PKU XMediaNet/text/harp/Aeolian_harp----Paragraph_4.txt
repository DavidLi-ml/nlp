Aeolian harps are featured in at least two Romantic-era poems: "The Eolian Harp" and "Dejection, an Ode", both by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In William Heinesen's novel The Lost Musicians, set in TÃ³rshavn, Kornelius Isaksen takes his three sons to a little church where, in the tower, they sit listening to the "capriciously varying sounds of an Aeolian harp", which leads the boys into a lifelong passion for music. A lyre is mentioned in Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind", which is another name for an Aeolian harp. The Aeolian harp is also mentioned in Shelley poem "Mutability", alongside his essay "A Defence of Poetry".
