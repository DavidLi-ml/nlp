In 1972, Chuck Hancock and Harry Bee recorded a giant 30-foot-tall (9.1 m) Aeolian harp designed and built by 22-year-old Thomas Ward McCain on a hilltop in Chelsea, Vermont. United released their double LP titled The Wind Harp: Song from the Hill. (An excerpt of this recording appears in the movie The Exorcist.) In the spirit of this, in 2003 an Aeolian harp was constructed at the Burning Man festival. Australian artist, composer and sound sculptor Alan Lamb has created and recorded several very large-scale Aeolian harps.
