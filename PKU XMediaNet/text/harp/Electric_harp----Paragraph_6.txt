In the late 20th century instrument builder and American musician Robert Grawi created an electric double harp-lute based on the West African kora but strung and tuned differently. The gravikord is a light ergonomically designed instrument made of modern materials mostly stainless steel tubing. It is a double harp that has 24 strings evenly divided in two ranks arrayed on a free standing "Vee" shaped bridge made of synthetic material including an integral piezo-electric sensor. The tuning of the gravikord is an extended version of the "G" major / "E" minor tuning system of the Hugh Tracey kalimba while its overall physical structure is derived from the African kora. Tones rise in a strictly alternate left right hand symmetry familiar to any thumb piano player, so that tunes and techniques learned on these instruments can be directly played on the gravikord. It was created to enable easier playing of complex African cross rhythms on an African derived modern electro-acoustic harp.
