The earliest harps and lyres were found in Sumer, 3500 B.C., and several harps were found in burial pits and royal tombs in Ur. The oldest depictions of harps without a forepillar can be seen in the wall paintings of ancient Egyptian tombs dating from as early as 3000 B.C. which show an instrument that closely resembles the hunter's bow, without the pillar that we find in modern harps.  The chang flourished in Persia in many forms from its introduction, about 3000 BC, until the 17th century.
