Not unlike the process of moving from the acoustic piano to the electric and eventually digital piano, the traditional harp being transformed by innovative amplification technologies, began in the 1950s with the late Casper Reardon and later, in the 70s, by Lloyd Lindroth. Lindroth integrated many electronic effects including distortion, digital delay, and reverb. At the time, it was new for guitars, let alone harps. Concurrently, Gail Laughton used electronic techniques in his classic recording of Harps of the Ancient Temples, foreshadowing the use of electronic effects to enhance live performance.
