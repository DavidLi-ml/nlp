Susan Mazer, with audiophile sound engineer Ron Robinson, developed a custom pre-amp for the Lyon and Healy electro-acoustic harp brought further clarity to the amplified harp sound. In addition, she developed a technique of playing the bass on the classical concert harp that had previously not been possible because of the excessive reverberation in the lower-end of the electroacoustic harp. This pre-amp has not been brought to market due to costs of development and concern for end-user pricing.
