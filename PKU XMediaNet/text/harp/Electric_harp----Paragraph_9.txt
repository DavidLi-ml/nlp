The MIDI harp possesses a piezo transducer that touches each string, allowing an electrical current to escape. The piezo pickup then outputs a current that corresponds to the vibration when the string is plucked. Once this occurs, the MIDI harp’s microprocessor that converts the analog signal to digital instruction devises a MIDI message that is sent by means of the MIDI-out port. In turn, the MIDI message can process the musician’s “pluck” and can decipher its volume and duration. ” Once the harpist is satisfied with the music being created, the specific sounds are stored within the instrument’s memory, similar to a computer file. The harpist may then proceed to transfer the composition by connecting the MIDI harp to a computer. With sufficient software, the harpist can apply the use of the MIDI harp’s “sustain pedal” in which it will successfully transfer the harpist’s composition measure-by-measure, and in its entirety.
