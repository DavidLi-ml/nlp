The minipiano, an instrument patented by the Brasted brothers of the Eavestaff Ltd. piano company, was patented in 1934. This instrument has a braceless back, and a soundboard positioned below the keysâ€”meaning that long metal rods pulled on the levers to make the hammers strike the strings. The first model, known as the Pianette,' was unique in that the tuning pins extended through the instrument, so it could be tuned at the front.
