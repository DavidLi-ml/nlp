Some BÃ¶sendorfer pianos, for example, extend the normal range down to F0, and one of their models has 97 keys reaches a bottom C0 for a full eight octave range. These extra keys are sometimes hidden under a small hinged lid that can cover the keys to prevent visual disorientation for pianists unfamiliar with the extra keys, or the colors of the extra white keys are reversed (black instead of white).
