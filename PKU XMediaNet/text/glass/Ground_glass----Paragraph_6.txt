Ground glass is widely used as a weather- and heat-proof light diffuser in ambient lighting, namely on glass covers or enclosures for lamp fixtures, and sometimes on incandescent bulbs. Its functions include preventing eye damage by direct looking at lamp filament, hiding unsightly details of the lamp and fixture without blocking its light, and producing a softer illumination without sharp shadows.
