Lead-oxide glass, crystal glass: silica 59% + lead oxide (PbO) 25% + potassium oxide (K2O) 12% + soda (Na2O) 2.0% + zinc oxide (ZnO) 1.5% + alumina 0.4%. Because of its high density (resulting in a high electron density) it has a high refractive index, making the look of glassware more brilliant (called "crystal", though of course it is a glass and not a crystal). It also has a high elasticity, making glassware "ring". It is also more workable in the factory, but cannot stand heating very well.
