Writing in the American Journal of Physics, the materials engineer Edgar D. Zanotto states "â€¦the predicted relaxation time for GeO2 at room temperature is 1032 years. Hence, the relaxation period (characteristic flow time) of cathedral glasses would be even longer." (1032 years is many times longer than the estimated age of the universe.)
