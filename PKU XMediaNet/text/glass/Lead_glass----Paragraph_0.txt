Lead glass, commonly called "crystal", is a variety of glass in which lead replaces the calcium content of a typical potash glass. Lead glass contains typically 18â€“40 weight% lead(II) oxide (PbO), while modern lead crystal, historically also known as flint glass due to the original silica source, contains a minimum of 24% PbO. Lead glass is desirable owing to its decorative properties.
