Green glass While very pale green is the typical colour of transparent glass, deeper greens can be achieved by the addition of Iron(II) oxide which results in a bluish-green glass. Together with chromium it gives glass of a richer green colour, typical of the glass used to make wine bottles. The addition of Chromium yields dark green glass, suitable for flashed glass. Together with tin oxide and arsenic it yields emerald green glass.
