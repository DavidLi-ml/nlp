Metallic gold, in very small concentrations (around 0.001%), produces a rich ruby-coloured glass ("ruby gold"); in lower concentrations it produces a less intense red, often marketed as "cranberry glass". The colour is caused by the size and dispersion of gold particles. Ruby gold glass is usually made of lead glass with tin added.
