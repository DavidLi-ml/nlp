Tank fill valves are found in all tank-style toilets. The valves are of two main designs: the side-float design and the concentric-float design. The side-float design has existed for over a hundred years. The concentric design has only existed since 1957, but is gradually becoming more popular than the side-float design. Fluidmaster, founded in the United States by inventor Adolf Schoepe, pioneered this design, which is also available from other manufacturers.
