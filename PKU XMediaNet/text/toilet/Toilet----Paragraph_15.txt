A pit toilet, or pit latrine, is a Dry toilet system which collects human excrement in a pit or trench, ranging from a simple slit trench to more elaborate systems with seating or squatting pans and ventilation systems. In developed countries they are associated with camping and wilderness areas, whereas they are common in rural or peri-urban areas of much of the developing world. Pit toilets are used in emergency situations.
