Dual flush toilets allow the user to select between a flush for urine or feces, saving a significant amount of water over conventional units. The flush handle on some of these toilets is pushed up for one kind of flush and down for the other. In other designs, a segmented flush pushbutton is used; pressing the smaller section releases less water.
