For thousands of years, humans have used the ability of certain animals to thrive on a diet of our excreta. With modern sanitation knowledge, the disease risk posed by these livestock toilets has been recognised, but nonetheless they continue to serve a function in the lives of peasants. The Pig toilet, which consists of a toilet linked to a Pigsty by a chute, is still in use to a limited extent. It was common in rural China, and was known in Japan, Korea, and India. The Fish pond toilet depends on the same principle, of livestock (often carp) eating human excreta directly. In China, "Family dwellings are commonly built close to the fish pond with toilets overhanging the pond to facilitate fertilization. [...] Some pigsties as well as latrines for humans are built on the adjacent dike so as to overhang the pond." But by 1988, these fish pond toilets were falling out of favour, as the farmers found it more useful to ferment human and pig excrement together, and apply it to the Aquaculture ponds as needed. In Vietnam, the traditional fish pond toilet, which was described as "widespread" as recently as 2008, polluted the waterways but was perceived as more hygenic (less smelly) than various modern alternatives that the government was pressing on the villagers.
