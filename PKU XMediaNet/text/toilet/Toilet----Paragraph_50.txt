Before the flush toilet's became as popular as it is, there were inventors, scientists, and Public health officials who supported the use of dry earth closets. One person developing these was the English clergyman Henry Moule, who dedicated his life to improving public sanitation after witnessing the horrors of the cholera epidemics of 1849 and 1854. Impressed by the insalubrity of the houses, especially in the summer of 1858, he invented what he called the dry earth system, similar to today's composting toilet.
