Its design makes use of air currents, a septic tank like pit, over which is built an upper structure with an open light-trap entrance and ventilation pipe from the bottom pit with a fine wire grate to keep out flies but more importantly to trap those entering the toilet hole from flying out towards the light. The result is hygienic, as flies can not escape from the fecal matter to spread disease, and the gases produced by the decomposing waste are redirected outside.
