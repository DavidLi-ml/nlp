In those settings, bucket toilets are more likely to be used without a plastic bag, or the bag is not removed each time the bucket is emptied. This is because the users cannot afford to regularly discard suitably sized, sturdy plastic bags. Instead, the users may place some dry material in the base of the bucket (newspaper, sawdust, leaves, straw or similar) in order to facilitate easier emptying.
