The amount of water used by conventional flush toilets usually make up a significant portion of personal daily water usage: for example, it could be 50 liters (13 U.S. gal) liters per person per day if a person flushes his or her toilet five times per day with 10 liters per flush. In some locations, users are encouraged not to flush after urination.
