An open bucket does not offer much protection to the user from the pathogens in the feces, leading to significant health risks. Flies can access the contents unless it is kept securely covered. There is also the risk that the bucket can tip over and spill its contents. Unhygienic emptying and disposal practices add further opportunities for pathogens to be spread.
