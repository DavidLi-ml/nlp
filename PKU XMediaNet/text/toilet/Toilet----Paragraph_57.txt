In the Western world, the most common method of cleaning the anal area after defecation is by toilet paper or sometimes by using a Bidet. In many Muslim countries, the faciliites are designed to enable people to follow Islamic toilet etiquette Qaḍāʼ al-Ḥājah. For example, a Bidet shower may be plumbed in. The left hand is used for cleansing, for which reason that hand is considered impolite or polluted in many Asian countries. Japanese toilet technology has created the washlet, a registered trademark referring to electric toilet seats with water spray feature for anal and genital cleansing.
