The bucket is emptied when it becomes full or emits excessive foul odor; usually once a day for large families, and about once a week for smaller families. If the bucket has a plastic bag then emptying is more hygienic than without a plastic bag, as the bag could be sealed with a knot and the bucket would remain fairly clean.
