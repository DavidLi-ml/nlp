A vault toilet is a non-flush toilet with a sealed container buried in the ground to receive the waste, all of which is contained underground until it is purposely removed by pumping. A vault toilet is distinguished from a pit toilet because the waste accumulates in the vault instead of seeping into the underlying soil. A vault toilet has similarities to a septic tank.
