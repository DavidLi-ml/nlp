A very recent discovery (2015) is a unique bass (or baritone) oboe in E-flat, in possession of Peter Hurd. This instrument, playable with a single-reed mouthpiece and clarinet reed, was very likely made for a pit or jazz band alto saxophonist to be able to switch to an ostensible double-reed instrument while continuing to use the same part and without significant embouchure alteration.
