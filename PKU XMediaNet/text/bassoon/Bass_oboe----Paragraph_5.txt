One of the most notable uses of the bass oboe is in Gustav Holst's "The Planets", where the instrument is used to great effect and provides a tone of which no other instrument is capable. Notable solo lines include some faint parts during "Mars", during the bitonal runs in the woodwind in "Mercury", numerous exposed lines in the quieter moments of "Saturn" (probably the best example of a solo in the whole work), and in the 5th and 6th bars of the bassoon's soli after the opening notes of "Uranus". The bass oboe is also prominently featured in the First Interlude of Sir Michael Tippett's Triple Concerto. There is also a very substantial solo in the second movement of Thomas Ades' "Asyla". Frederick Delius scored for the bass oboe in a number of works, including Songs of Sunset, A Mass of Life, Requiem, An Arabesque, Fennimore and Gerda and Dance Rhapsody No. 1, however, the latest research reveals that despite his use of this term, Delius' intended instrument was the Heckelphone. Arnold Bax calls for it in his Symphony No. 1, and Havergal Brian requires an instrument in both the Gothic Symphony and his Symphony No. 4 Das Siegeslied. Percy Grainger includes the bass oboe in Children's March and The Warriors.
