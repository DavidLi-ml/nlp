In many regards the smaller bassoons play much like the full-size bassoon. Currently there are three sizes available from four different makers. Moosmann makes an instrument in F (a fourth higher than the normal bassoon) with simplified fingerings that descends only to low C and is intended for young children. The company Bassetto in Switzerland produces instruments in G (a fifth higher) and has an added bonus of a model with an altissimo vent in the bocal, but no whisper key. Bruno Salenson in NÃ®mes in France is producing a 'petit basson' in E flat with simplified French or German keywork, specifically for children. Howarth of London markets instruments designed and manufactured by Guntram Wolf both in F and in G (respectively called by the company "tenoroon" and "mini-bassoon"). Guntram Wolf (of Kronach, Bavaria) makes and sells his own F and G models, plus an octave bassoon one full octave higher than the normal bassoon. He also offers all three instruments with extra keywork for professional players: the F and G instruments having a full whisper key mechanism and F-F# link; and the octave bassoon (called "Fagottino" by Wolf) can have up to nine keys, adding a wing speaker key, and C#, B flat, F#, and low E flat keys to the basic children's model. By far the most used of these would appear to be the Wolf instruments: the model in G or quint-bassoon is marketed more toward children as its slightly smaller size suits them better, while the F or quart-bassoon is more suited to older children or professionals due to its slightly bigger size as well as its feeling and sounding more like a full-sized bassoon, although in its basic children's model it has limited professional use due to the lack of full modern keywork and indeed some professional players using this instrument have opted to have alternative F# and G# keys added to Wolf's professional instrument (standard features on the regular bassoon) to facilitate the playing of more advanced music.
