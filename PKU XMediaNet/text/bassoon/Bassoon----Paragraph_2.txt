The range of the bassoon begins at Bâ™­1 (the first one below the bass staff) and extends upward over three octaves, roughly to the G above the treble staff (G5). Higher notes are possible but difficult to produce, and rarely called for: orchestral and concert band parts rarely go higher than C5 or D5. Even Stravinsky's famously difficult opening solo in The Rite of Spring only ascends to D5.
