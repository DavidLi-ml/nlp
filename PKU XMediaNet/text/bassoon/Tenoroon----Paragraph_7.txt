The sound of the tenor bassoon can be compared to that of a dull English Horn and has been described as somewhat saxophone-like. It can make an excellent tenor or alto voice in a wind ensemble or orchestra (the latter could benefit from having a true tenor instrument in the woodwind department). It could effectively bridge the octave (or octave and a half if bass oboe is omitted) gap between the bassoon family and the oboe family. Although it does not effectively extend the range of the bassoon, it can be used to give more flexibility in that range where the bassoon lacks in mobility.
