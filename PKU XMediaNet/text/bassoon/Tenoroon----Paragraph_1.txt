Many debates have been had on the nomenclature of the smaller bassoons. All small bassoons have at one time or another been called fagottino (pl. fagottini), but this term is historically usually only applied to the octave bassoon. The terms quart-bassoon (Quartfagott) and quint-bassoon (Quintfagott) are applied respectively to the instruments pitched a fourth above and a fifth above the normal bassoon. To add to the confusion, these terms can also be applied to instruments a fifth lower (quint-bassoon in F) and a fourth lower (quart-bassoon in G) known as semi contrabassoons. Note that the keys of the lower and higher versions are reversed. Often the terms bass and tenor or high are added to clarify which instrument one is talking about (e.g. quart-bass bassoon or high quint-bassoon [hochquintfagott]). One of the most common terms used to describe these instruments is the term tenoroon which is a contraction of "tenor bassoon," which is the more correct title of the instrument although tenoroon is quite accepted nowadays. Altoon (the combination of the words alto and bassoon), as a moniker for the smaller octave bassoon has yet to catch on. A recently introduced alternative is the Fagonello which is of similar size and weight to these smaller bassoons, but plays at the normal pitch, albeit with a slightly reduced range.
