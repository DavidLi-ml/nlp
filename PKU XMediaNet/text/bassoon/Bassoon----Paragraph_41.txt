The bassoon embouchure is a very important aspect of producing a full, round bassoon tone, but can be difficult to obtain as a beginner. The bassoon embouchure is made by putting one's lips together as if one were whistling and then dropping the jaw down as in a yawning motion (without actually yawning or opening the mouth). Both sets of teeth should be covered by the lips in order to protect the reed and control applied pressure. The reed is then placed in the mouth, forming a seal around the reed with the lips and facial muscles.
