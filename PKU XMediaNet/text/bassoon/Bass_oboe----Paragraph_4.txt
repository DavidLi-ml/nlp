The instrument has been manufactured sporadically by various companies, including F. Lor√©e, Marigaux, Rigoutat, Fossati, and others. It is usually a "special order" instrument, and its purchase price normally exceeds that of a top-of-the-line English horn. Another similar instrument, the Lupophon, has been developed by Guntram Wolf, who describes it as "the new bass oboe".
