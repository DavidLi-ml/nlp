Some confusion exists between the bass oboe and the Heckelphone, a double reed instrument of similar register introduced by the firm of Wilhelm Heckel in 1904, and which is distinguished from standard members of the oboe family by its wider bore, different fingering system (on older instruments), and larger bell. As a result it is not always clear in English orchestral works of the early 20th century which of the two instruments is intended when the composer requests "bass oboe".
