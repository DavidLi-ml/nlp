Instruments pitched an octave above the bassoon are, like all smaller bassoons, historically quite old instruments. Virtually no literature exists for this size of bassoon other than a Partita by Frost (or Trost?) and a Cantata by Zachau (which specifies "Bassonetti" which would appear to be small bassoons). The instrument has enjoyed something of a revival in the past decade. Once again both historically accurate copies and modern instruments are being constructed. The modern instruments are very simple in their fingering, needing only four keys (although as many of nine or more can be had), considerably fewer keys than the original bassoon. The instrument is not, however, fully chromatic. It lacks the bottom B-natural and C-sharp, which is akin to Baroque and Classical instruments. This instrument is not a remedy for high notes on the bassoon nor can it extend the range considerably. The “octave bassoon” can generally only reach the written F above the bass clef (but sounding an octave higher) although professionals may be able to extend this range. The sound is thin and would not be out of place in a Renaissance or Baroque wind ensemble. Due to the somewhat smaller size and abundance of cross-fingerings, technique on the octave bassoon may be somewhat challenging for a non-professional.
