Children's dinosaur books commonly feature Compsognathus. For a long time they were unique in their small size, as most other small dinosaurs were discovered and described a century or more later. These animals have appeared in the movies The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. In The Lost World: Jurassic Park, one of the characters incorrectly identifies the species as "Compsognathus triassicus", combining the genus name of Compsognathus longipes with the specific name of Procompsognathus triassicus, a distantly related small carnivore featured in the Jurassic Park novels.
