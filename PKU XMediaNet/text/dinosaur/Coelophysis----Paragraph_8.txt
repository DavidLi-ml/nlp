Several paleontologists consider Coelophysis bauri to be the same dinosaur as Coelophysis rhodesiensis (formerly Syntarsus, alternately Megapnosaurus), however this has been refuted by the following: Downs (2000) concluded that C. bauri differs from C. rhodesiensis in cervical length, proximal and distal hindlimb proportions and proximal caudal vertebral anatomy; Tykoski and Rowe (2004) concluded that C. bauri differs from C. rhodesiensis in that it lacks a pit at the base of the nasal process of the premaxilla; and Bristowe and Raath (2004) concluded that C. bauri differs from C. rhodesiensis in having a longer maxillary tooth row.
