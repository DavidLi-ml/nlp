Therrien and Fastovsky (2001) examined the paleoenvironment of Coelophysis and other early theropods from Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona, and determined that this genus lived during the Late Triassic in an environment that consisted of floodplains marked by distinct dry and wet seasons. There was a great deal of competition during drier times when animals struggled for water in riverbeds that were drying up. The contemporary archosaurs of Coelophysis in Chinle Formation were the crurotarsan Revueltosaurus; the phytosaurs Leptosuchus, Paleorhinus, Pseudopalatus, Redondasaurus and possibly Rutiodon; several aetosaurs, including Acaenasuchus, Desmatosuchus, Paratypothorax, Stagonolepis, and Typothorax; the crocodilomorphs Hesperosuchus, and Parrishia; the rauisuchians Shuvosaurus, Effigia, Poposaurus, Postosuchus, and Saurosuchus; the dinosauriform Eucoelophysis; and the dinosaurs Chindesaurus, Camposaurus, Daemonosaurus, and Gojirasaurus. Coelophysis also lived alongside the archosauromorphs Crosbysaurus, Tanytrachelos, Tecovasaurus, Trilophosaurus, and Vancleavea; the other amniotes Acallosuchus, Colognathus, Kraterokheirodon, Placerias, and Uatchitodon; the amphibians Apachesaurus, and Koskinonodon; and the fish Acrodus, Lonchidion, Phoebodus, Reticulodus, Xenacanthus, Chinlea, Arganodus, Australosomus, Lasalichthyes, and Turseodus.
