According to Ezcurra (2007), and Bristowe and Raath (2004) Coelophysis can be distinguished based on the following features: the absence of an offset rostral process of the maxilla; the quadrate is strongly caudally; a small external mandibular fenestra, which is 9-10% of the mandibular length; and the anteroposterior length of the ventral lacrimal process is greater than 30% of its height.
