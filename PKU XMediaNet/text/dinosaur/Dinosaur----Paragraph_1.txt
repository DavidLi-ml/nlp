Until the late 20th century, all groups of dinosaurs were believed to be extinct; however, the fossil record indicates that birds are the modern descendants of feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from theropod ancestors during the Jurassic Period, and are now termed "avian dinosaurs". As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the mass extinction event. Throughout the remainder of this article, the term "dinosaur" is sometimes used generically to refer to both the avian and non-avian dinosaurs combined, while at other times it is used to refer to the non-avian dinosaurs specifically, and the avian dinosaurs are sometimes simply referred to as "birds". This article deals primarily with non-avian dinosaurs.
