DOT laws vary by state, but for the most part minibikes are illegal for use on public roadways because most do not carry the necessary equipment (and often size requirements) to be street legal. In many states the seat of a motorcycle must be at least 25 inches (64 cm) off the ground, which is often a limiting factor in registration. Usage on public roadways may result a number of offenses, including but not limited to: no indicator lights, no rearview mirror, no horn or signaling device, no headlight, too-small muffler (noise pollution), improper lane change (no blinkers), or reckless driving.
