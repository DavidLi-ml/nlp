In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfm√ºller became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a motorcycle (German: Motorrad). However, only a few hundred examples of this motorcycle were ever built. The first instance of the term "motor cycle" also appears in English the same year in materials promoting machines developed by E.J. Pennington, although Pennington's motorcycles never progress past the prototype stage.
