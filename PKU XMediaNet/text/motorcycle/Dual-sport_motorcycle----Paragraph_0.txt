A dual-sport motorcycle is a type of street-legal motorcycle that is designed for both on and off-road use. The terms all-road and dual-purpose are also used for this class of motorcycles. Dual-sports are equipped with street-legal equipment such as lights, speedometer, mirrors, horn, license plate mounting, and muffler and can, therefore, be registered and licensed.
