In addition to the Vehicle Type Approval, to be ridden on the road the minibike must be registered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, display a valid road tax disc (vehicle excise duty), and the driver or rider must be aged 17 or over (or 16 if the vehicle meets the definition of a moped), have an appropriate driving license, and insurance. The only exceptions relate to electrically-assisted pedal cycles and mobility aids for disabled people. In the UK there are in most areas mini bike tracks for the public.
