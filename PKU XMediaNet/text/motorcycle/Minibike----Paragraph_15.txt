In Canada mini motorcycles, commonly referred to as “pocket bikes” or "mini choppers,” do not meet federal safety standards for use on public roads. These vehicles do not meet minimum height specifications for headlamps, tail lamps, stop lamps, and turn signals. They are also difficult for other motorists to see.
