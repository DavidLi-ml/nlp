Some of the larger "super" pocket bikes, most commonly the X15 (FS549), X18 (FS559), X19 (FS569), and X22 could meet all the requirements. However, they were imported and sold as "off road use purposes only". In some states, they could be registered for legal street use by converting an off-road purposes only bike into a road-worthy model. These bikes had headlights, turn signals, tail/brake lights, a horn, and speedometer, and could also do the speed limit in most scenarios (typically 4 stroke bikes with manual 4 speed transmissions can reach speeds of 55 mph). In many states all one needs to do is add a rearview mirror and a license plate bracket, but it is best to check with local DMV authorities for exact requirements. In some cases, if the bike requires minor modification to meet requirements, one may be able to register it as a "unique/home-built."
