Motorcycles may only be driven on a motorcycle (class 6) licence; a moped can be driven on a car (class 1) licence. Riders on their learners or restricted motorcycle licence can only ride approved motorcycles on the Learner Approved Motorcycle Scheme list. These motorcycles must have an engine capacity of 660 cc or less and a power-to-weight ratio of 150 kW/tonne or less (when including a 90 kg rider). Motorcycles with an engine capacity of 250 cc or less are automatically approves, except for a small number of high-performance machines. Pre-1960 motorcycles are exempt from the power-to-weight ratio restriction.
