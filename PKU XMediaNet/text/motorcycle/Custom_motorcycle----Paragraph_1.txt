Some motorcycle manufacturers, such as Harley-Davidson and Honda, include the word "custom" as part of a model name. The factory custom segment has become the most visible in the custom industry in recent years. The original factory custom was the 1971 Harley-Davidson Super Glide, designed by Willie G. Davidson, which, imitating the custom scene of the time, combined the fork from a Sportster with the frame and engine of a big twin Electra Glide, thereby founding a style imitated by many other manufactures ever since.
