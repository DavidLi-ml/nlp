Minibikes are not toys, although often treated as such. Even the cheapest 38 cc US-made bikes (often sold for as little as $150) are capable of speeds of at least 25 mph (40 km/h). The 49 cc pocket bikes can reach speeds of 30 to 45 mph (48 to 72 km/h), and the 110â€“125 cc four-stroke bikes are capable of 60-80 mph. Gasoline-powered bikes are substantially faster and require more skill than off-the-shelf electric bikes, which typically can not exceed 10 to 15 mph (16 to 24 km/h).
