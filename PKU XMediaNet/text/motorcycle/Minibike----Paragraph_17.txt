In Ontario, pocket bikes may not be operated on public roads, sidewalks, or parks. It is recommended riders be twelve years of age or older to ride pocket bikes. The minimum fine for being caught while riding a Pocket Bike on anything but private property is $5000, which does not include other fines such as reckless driving which an officer may choose to charge. Although many people unknowingly disobey the law by riding these bikes in side walks and parks, police officers do not fine riders without a complaint from other people. Pocket bikes may not be driven on highways under any circumstances.
