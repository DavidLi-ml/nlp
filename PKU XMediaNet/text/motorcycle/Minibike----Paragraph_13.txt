Like real full-size motorcycles, the rider of a modified super pocket bike must carry insurance, have a current inspection, and wear a helmet if local laws require it. Depending on if the state classes a pocketbike as a "moped" or full "motorcycle", the rider may or may not need a special motorcycle license. If not, a regular driver's license may suffice.
