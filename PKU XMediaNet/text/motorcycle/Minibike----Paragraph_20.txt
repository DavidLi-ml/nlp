In the UK, it is illegal for minibikes to be ridden on public roads or off-road on public land. The only places these types of vehicle may be ridden are purpose-built race tracks and privately owned land with the owner's permission (and where they do not cause harassment, alarm or distress). All of these minibikes are regarded as "motor vehicles" as defined by section 185 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 and so to be ridden on the public road, a motor vehicle must comply with all aspects of road traffic law and meet the mandatory European construction requirements by having a "Certificate of Conformity" indicating that they have European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval (ECWVTA).
