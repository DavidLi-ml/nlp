To progress to a provisional licence, the rider must successfully complete a pre-provisional riders course, followed by a riding skills test called MOST (Motorcycle Operator Skill Test). The rider is then able to obtain a P1 provisional licence enabling a new upper speed limit of 90 kilometres per hour (56 mph) and giving the rider a maximum of four demerit points. These licences can be renewed and must be held without suspension for 12 months, after which time it can be upgraded to a P2 provisional licence, which is then to be held for 2 more years before the rider obtains their full licence, providing they have not breached any laws causing them to be suspended or disqualified in that period. P2 provisional riders have an upper speed limit of 100 kilometres per hour (62 mph) and a maximum of seven demerit points. P2 provisional riders are permitted to carry a pillion, P1 riders are not. There are exceptions to this rule for mature age licence holders who also hold an unrestricted drivers license, who may be eligible to bypass the P2 provisional period.
