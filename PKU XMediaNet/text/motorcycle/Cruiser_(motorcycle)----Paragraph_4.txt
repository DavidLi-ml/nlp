Many power cruisers and Japanese cruisers of the 1980s have more neutral riding positions. While typical cruisers have limited performance and turning ability due to a low-slung design, power cruisers or similar performance-oriented cruisers can be leaned farther for better cornering. Otherwise, customization can increase the bike's lean angle to enable cornering at higher speeds.
