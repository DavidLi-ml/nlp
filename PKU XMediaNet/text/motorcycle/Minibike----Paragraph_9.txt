Midi motos, also called super pocket bikes, are similar to pocket bikes, but slightly larger. They are still smaller than the street bikes they mimic, but the seat height is about a foot to two feet higher than a mini moto's seat height. They started off with 47cc 2 stroke engines (capable of around 48–64 km/h/30-40 mph) in the midi motos and then included 110cc 4 stroke engines (capable of around 86–105 km/h/55-65 mph). Most midi bikes are made in China and usually equipped with a Honda engine or copy of a Honda engine.
