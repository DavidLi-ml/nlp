A skeleton key is a key that has been filed or cut to create a master that can be used to unlock a variety of warded locks each with a different configuration of wards. This can usually be done by removing most of the centre of the key, allowing it to pass by the wards without interference, operating the lock. To counteract the illicit creation of such keys, locksmiths can put wards not just in the centre but on the outside as well, making the creation of a skeleton key more difficult.
