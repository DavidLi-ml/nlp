A tubular key (sometimes referred to as a ace, radial or barrel key) is one that is designed to open a tubular pin tumbler lock. It has a hollow, cylindrical shaft that is usually much shorter and has a larger diameter than most conventional keys. Tubular keys are commonly found on vending machines, launderettes, bike locks (such as the kryptonite lock) and laptop security cables.
