The "return" key is often also referred to by many American groups (and even marked) as the "enter" key, and they usually perform identical functions; however in some particular applications (mainly page layout, word processing and in typewriting), "return" operates specifically like the carriage return key from which it originates. It normally has an arrow pointing down and left (⏎ or ↵), which is the symbol for carriage return. In contrast, the "Enter" key is commonly labelled with its name in plain text on generic PC keyboards, or with the symbol ⌤ (U+2324 up arrowhead between two horizontal bars) on many Apple Mac keyboards.)
