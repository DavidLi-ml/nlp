Green is used as a backdrop more than any other color because image sensors in digital video cameras are most sensitive to green, due to the Bayer pattern allocating more pixels to the green channel, mimicking the human eye's increased sensitivity to green light. Therefore, the green camera channel contains the least "noise" and can produce the cleanest key, matte, or mask. Additionally, less light is needed to illuminate green, again because of the higher sensitivity to green in image sensors. Bright green has also become favored since a blue background may match a subject's eye color or common items of clothing such as jeans.
