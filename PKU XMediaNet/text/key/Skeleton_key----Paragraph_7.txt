These keys were common in both cabinetry and door locks in early Colonial America and remained in common usage within the United States through the 1940s, giving way after World War II to the pin tumbler lock. Most keys of this type and their locks were formed of brass, although pewter was sometimes used. They were commonly available at hardware and other stores. Today, lever lock keys are associated with fine cabinetry.
