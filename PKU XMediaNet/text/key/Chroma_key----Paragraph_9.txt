Some films make heavy use of chroma key to add backgrounds that are constructed entirely using computer-generated imagery (CGI). Performances from different takes can be composited together, which allows actors to be filmed separately and then placed together in the same scene. Chroma key allows performers to appear to be in any location without leaving the studio. The comedy show Tosh.0 in particular is known for filming entirely with green-screen and then cutting the image being produced by the computer to show Daniel Tosh standing directly on the purely green set. This is always done at the very end of the show.
