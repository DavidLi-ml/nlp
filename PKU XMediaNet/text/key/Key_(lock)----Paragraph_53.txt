A practical attack exists to create a working master key for an entire system given only access to a single master-keyed lock, its associated change key, a supply of appropriate key blanks, and the ability to cut new keys. This is described in a 2002 paper by cryptographer Matt Blaze, however for systems with many levels of master keys it may be necessary to collect information from locks in different "subsystems" in order to deduce the master key.
