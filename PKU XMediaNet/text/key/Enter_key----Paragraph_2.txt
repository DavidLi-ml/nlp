The enter key is typically located on the lower right of the numeric keypad, and the return/enter key on the right edge of the main alphanumeric portion of the keyboard, between backspace and the right-hand shift (and/or control) key (as well as below the backslash key on keyboards using a standard ANSI / US-International layout).
