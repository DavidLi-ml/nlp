A backshot wheel (also called pitchback) is a variety of overshot wheel where the water is introduced just behind the summit of the wheel. It combines the advantages from breastshot and overshot systems, since the full amount of the potential energy released by the falling water is harnessed as the water descends the back of the wheel (as in overshot wheel) while it also gains power from the water's current past the bottom of the wheel (as in breastshot wheel).
