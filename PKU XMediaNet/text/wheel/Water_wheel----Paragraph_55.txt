The direction of rotation of a backshot wheel is the same as that of a breastshot wheel at the same location so it can easily replace one, without causing the directional gearing in the mill to be changed. This would increase the power available while only requiring a change to be made to the water level in the top pond, which in some cases is economically viable.
