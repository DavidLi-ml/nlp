The earliest excavated water wheel driven by tidal power was the Nendrum Monastery mill in Northern Ireland which has been dated at 787A.D. although a possible earlier mill dates to 619A.D. Tide mills became common in estuaries with a good tidal range in both Europe and America generally using undershot wheels.
