A recent development of the breastshot wheel is a hydraulic wheel which effectively incorporates automatic regulation systems. The Aqualienne is one example. It generates between 37 kW and 200 kW of electricity from a 20mÂ³ waterflow with a head of 1 to 3.5m. It is designed to produce electricity at the sites of former watermills.
