The Romans used water wheels extensively in mining projects. Several such devices were described by Vitruvius. The one found during modern mining at the copper mines at Rio Tinto in Spain involved 16 such wheels stacked above one another so as to lift water about 80 feet (24 m) from the mine sump. Part of a similar wheel dated to about 90 CE, was found in the 1930s, at Dolaucothi, a Roman gold mine in south Wales.
