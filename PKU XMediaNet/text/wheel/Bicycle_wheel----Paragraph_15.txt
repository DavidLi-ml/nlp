On traditionally-spoked wheels, flange spacing affects the lateral stiffness of the wheel, with wider being stiffer, and flange diameter effects the torsional stiffness of the wheel and the number of spoke holes that the hub can accept, with larger diameter being stiffer and accepting more holes. Asymmetrical flange diameters, tried to mitigate the adverse effects of asymmetrical spacing and dish necessary on rear wheels with many sprockets, have also been with modest benefits.
