The Alectroenas blue pigeons are closely interrelated and occur widely throughout islands in the western Indian Ocean. They are allopatric and can therefore be regarded as a superspecies. There are three extant species; the Madagascar blue pigeon, the Comoros blue pigeon, and the Seychelles blue pigeon. The three Mascarene islands were home to a species each, which are all extinct; the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Rodrigues blue pigeon, and the RÃ©union blue pigeon. Compared to other pigeons, the blue pigeons are medium to large, stocky, have comparatively long wings and tails. They all have distinct mobile hackles on thehead and neck. The tibiotarsus is comparatively long and the tarsometatarsus short.
