The blue pigeons perhaps colonised the Mascarenes, the Seychelles or a now submerged hot spot island by "island hopping" and evolved into a distinct genus there before reaching Madagascar. Their closest genetic relative is the cloven-feathered dove, Drepanoptila holosericea, of New Caledonia, which they separated from 8â€“9 million years ago. Their ancestral group appears to be the fruit doves, Ptilinopus, of Southeast Asia and Oceania.
