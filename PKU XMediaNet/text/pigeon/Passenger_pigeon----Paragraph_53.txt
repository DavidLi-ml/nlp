The last recorded nest and egg in the wild were collected in 1895 near Minneapolis. The last wild individual in Louisiana was discovered among a flock of mourning doves in 1896, and subsequently shot. Many late sightings are thought to be false or due to confusion with mourning doves. The last fully authenticated record of a wild passenger pigeon was near Sargents, Pike County, Ohio, on March 22 or 24, 1900, when a female bird was killed by a boy named Press Clay Southworth with a BB gun. The boy had not recognized the bird as a passenger pigeon, but his parents identified it, and sent it to a taxidermist. The specimen, nicknamed "buttons" due to the buttons used instead of glass eyes, was donated to the Ohio Historical Society by the family in 1915. Though this is the most often cited last wild specimen, in 2014, writer Joel Greenberg pointed out two later records, one of which involves a male shot in 1902 in Indiana, that was stuffed but later destroyed. The reliability of later accounts are in question. US President Theodore Roosevelt claimed to have seen a bird in Michigan in 1907. Ornithologist Alexander Wetmore claimed that he saw a pair flying near Independence, Kansas, in April 1905. In 1910, the American Ornithologists' Union offered a reward of $3,000 for discovering a nest â€“ the equivalent of $76,990.05 in 2015.
