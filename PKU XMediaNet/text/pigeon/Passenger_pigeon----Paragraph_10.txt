The adult female passenger pigeon was slightly smaller than the male at 38 to 40 cm (15.0 to 15.7 in) in length. It was duller than the male overall, and was a grayish-brown on the forehead, crown, and nape down to the scapulars, and the feathers on the sides of the neck had less iridescence than those of the male. The lower throat and breast were a buff-gray that developed into white on the belly and undertail-coverts. It was browner on the upperparts and paler buff brown and less rufous on the underparts than the male. The wings, back, and tail were similar in appearance to those of the male except that the outer edges of the primary feathers were edged in buff or rufous buff. The wings had more spotting than those of the male. The tail was shorter than that of the male, and the legs and feet were a paler red. The iris was orange red, with a grayish blue, naked orbital ring. The wing of the female was 180–210 mm (7.1–8.3 in), the tail 150–200 mm (5.9–7.9 in), the bill 15–18 mm (0.59–0.71 in), and the tarsus was 25–28 mm (0.98–1.10 in).
