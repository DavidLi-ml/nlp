The bird is believed to have played a significant ecological role in the composition of presettlement forests of eastern North America. For instance, while the passenger pigeon was extant, forests were dominated by white oaks. This species germinated in the fall, therefore producing acorns during the spring to be devoured and spread by the pigeons. The absence of the passenger pigeon's seed dispersal may have led to the modern dominance of red oaks. At roosting sites, few plants grew for years after the pigeons left. Also, the immense amount of dung present at these sites increased both the frequency and intensity of forest fires. With the large numbers in the flocks, the excrement they produced was enough to destroy surface-level vegetation, and along with the breaking of treelimbs under their collective weight, the passenger pigeons could do significant damage to forests. Due to these influences, some ecologists have considered the passenger pigeon a keystone species. The American chestnut trees that provided much of the mast on which the passenger pigeon fed was itself almost driven to extinction by an imported Asian fungus (chestnut blight) around 1905. As many as thirty billion trees are thought to have died as a result in the following decades, but this did not affect the passenger pigeon, which was already extinct in the wild at the time.
