The passenger pigeon had a very elastic mouth and throat, allowing for increased capacity, and a joint in the lower bill enabled it to swallow acorns whole. The bird was also able to store large quantities of food in its crop, which was capable of expanding to about the size of an orange, causing the neck to bulge. This allowed a bird to quickly grab any food it discovered in the highly competitive flock. The crop was described as being capable of holding at least 17 acorns or 28 beechnuts, 11 grains of corn, 100 maple seeds, plus other material; it was estimated that a passenger pigeon needed to eat about 61 cm3 (3.7 in3) of food a day in order to survive. If shot, a pigeon with a crop full of nuts would fall to the ground with a sound described as like the rattle of a bag of marbles. After feeding, the pigeons perched on branches and digested the food stored in their crop overnight. The pigeon could eat and digest 0.100 kg (0.22 lb) of acorns per day. At the historic population of three billion passenger pigeons, this amounted to 210,000,000 L (55,000,000 US gal) of food a day. The pigeon was also able to regurgitate food from its crop when more desirable food became available.
