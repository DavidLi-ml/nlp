In 2013, it was reported that Foldable OLED smartphones could be as much as a decade away because of the anticipated cost of producing them is dropping. However, as of 2013, there is a relatively high failure rate when producing these screens. As little as a speck of dust can ruin a screen during production. As well, creating a battery that can be folded is another hurdle. In 2014, it was reported that future smartphones might not have a traditional battery as their sole source of power. Instead, they may pull energy from radio, television, cellular or Wi-Fi signals.
