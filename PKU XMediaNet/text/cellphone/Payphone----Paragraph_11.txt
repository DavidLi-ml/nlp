In the Soviet period different types of payphones were produced. There were also long-distance call payphones costing 15 kopeiks, and also provided services of a paid media such as listenimg to an anecdote, obtain legal advice, find the address of the subscriber by phone number. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the monetary reform of 1991 this form of payment has become irrelevant. Some payphones have undergone modifications: coin acceptors were altered to accept coins or replace the card reader. For example, in St Petersburg payment for pay phone can be made with metro tokens. In some regions, calls from pay phones are free of charge.
