In early 2014, smartphones were beginning to use Quad HD (2K) 2560x1440 on 5.5" screens with up to 534 PPI on devices such as the LG G3 which is a significant improvement over Apple's Retina Display. Quad HD is used in advanced televisions and computer monitors, but with 110 ppi or less on such larger displays. In 2014, Wi-Fi networks were used a lot for smartphones. As Wi-Fi became more prevalent and easier to connect to, it was predicted that Wi-Fi phone services will start to take off. In 2014, LG introduced lasers on the LG G3 to help camera focus. In 2014, some smartphones had such good digital cameras that they could be categorized as high-end point-and-shoot cameras with large sensors up to 1" with 20 megapixels and 4K video. Some can store their pictures in proprietary raw image format, but the Android (operating system) 5.0 Lollipop serves open source RAW images. By 2015, smartphones were increasingly integrated with everyday uses. For instance, credit cards, mobile payments, and mobile banking were integrated into smartphone applications and Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms. Additionally, recent technological innovations are causing the role of traditional keys to be fused into the smartphones, because a smartphone can act as a digital key and access badge for its users. In October 2015, Microsoft announced Windows Continuum, a feature that allows users to connect their devices to an external monitor via Microsoft Continuum Display Dock. HP adds a layer to the Continuum with their HP Workplace which enables user to run a Win32 app by a virtualized server. The first modular smartphone available to the public was the Fairphone 2, which was released in December 2015. Unlike most smartphones, users can remove and replace parts on this phone.
