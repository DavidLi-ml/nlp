There are two common theories regarding the divergence of Balinese and Javan tigers: The first suggests that the two subspecies developed when Bali became isolated from Java by formation of the Bali Strait due to rising sea levels after the ice age. This split the tigers into two groups which then went on to develop independently. The second possibility is that the tigers swam from one island to colonize the other. The Bali Strait is only 2.4 km wide, making it well within the swimming ability of the average tiger.
