The Bengal tiger, also called the royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), is the most numerous tiger subspecies. It is the national animal of both India and Bangladesh. By 2011, the total population was estimated at fewer than 2,500 individuals with a decreasing trend. None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within the Bengal tiger's range is considered large enough to support an effective population size of 250 adult individuals. Since 2010, it has been classified as endangered by the IUCN.
