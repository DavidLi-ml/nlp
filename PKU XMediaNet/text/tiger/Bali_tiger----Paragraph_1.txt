The last specimen definitely recorded was a female shot at Sumbar Kima, west Bali, on 27 September 1937. However, a few animals likely survived into the 1940s and possibly 1950s. The subspecies became extinct because of habitat loss and hunting. Given the small size of the island and limited forest cover, the original population could never have been large.
