An analysis of craniodental and pelage morphology, ecology, and molecular biology of the tiger subspecies indicates that they have many traits in common and that the genetic diversity between them is low. The authors of this analysis suggest to group the Bengal, Indochinese, Malayan, South China, and Siberian tiger subspecies to the Continental tiger Panthera tigris tigris; and the Sumatran, Javan and Bali tiger subspecies to the Sunda tiger Panthera tigris sondaica. This classification is intended to facilitate tiger conservation management, both regarding breeding programmes in zoos and future translocations in the wild. The classification is criticised by several geneticists, who maintain that the currently recognised nine subspecies can be distinguished genetically.
