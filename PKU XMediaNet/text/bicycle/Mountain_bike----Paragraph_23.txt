It should be noted that in the early days of mountain biking, all mountain bikes were somewhat custom, home-built machines, and were used for any number of stunts, tricks, racing or other activities. The general design of the bikes were similar. As the sport grew, more specialized designs and equipment were introduced. The further market segmentation beyond simple front suspension XC began to occur in the mid-1990s, as large bicycle and equipment manufacturers were able to cater specifically to changing demands.
