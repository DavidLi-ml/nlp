Downhill (DH) bikes typically have eight or more inches (200 mm) of suspension travel, and extremely low, slack geometry intended to set the rider in a comfortable position when descending steep trails at high speed. Due to their often high gear ratios, soft suspension, and aggressive geometry, Downhill bikes are ideal only for riding down dedicated trails or race courses, almost universally requiring the bike to be carried uphill rather than ridden. Downhill frames are often intended for racing, and as such are required to be both extremely durable and lightweight. Bicycle designers often make use of similar materials in the construction of Downhill and XC frames and components (e.g. carbon fiber), despite their vastly different purposes, as the ultimate goal of a high strength to weight ratio is the same. In recent years, more advanced frame and component designs have produced high end downhill bikes with similar weights to average Trail and All-Mountain bikes, with an increasing expectation that complete downhill bikes remain below 40 lbs (18 kg) even in budget models. This advancement, along with increased speeds and forces in racing, and the use of downhill frames for freeride applications, has necessitated or otherwise inspired many unique design features and advancements in design present on Downhill bikes, many of which later find use on less aggressive types of bikes (bash guards, clutch derailleurs, wide handlebars, advanced air suspension, bimetallic brake rotors, slack and long geometry). Several types of bicycle speed records have been registered using Downhill bikes.
