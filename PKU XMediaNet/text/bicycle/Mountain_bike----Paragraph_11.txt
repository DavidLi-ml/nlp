Enduro/all-mountain (AM) bikes bridge the gap between cross-country and freeride bikes, such as the Trek Remedy series, Specialized Enduro, typically weighing between 13 to 16 kilograms (29 to 35 lb). These bikes tend to feature greater suspension travel, frequently as much as 6 inches (150 mm) or 7" of front and rear travel, often adjustable on newer mid- and high-end bikes. Designed to be able to climb and descend well, these bikes are intended to be taken on all-day rides involving both steep climbs and steep descents, hence the term 'all-mountain'. In terms of aggressiveness, these bikes are intended for anywhere from 50-70% downhill riding, and 30-50% uphill riding, bridging the gap between Trail and Downhill bikes. In recent years, there has been somewhat of a split between Enduro and All-Mountain bikes, with the former placing more emphasis on descent due to the increased emphasis on timed downhill runs in Enduro racing when compared to more typical All-Mountain riding.
