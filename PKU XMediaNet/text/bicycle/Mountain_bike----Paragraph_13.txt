Freeride (FR) mountain bikes are similar to downhill bikes, with less emphasis on weight and more on strength, though many frame and component manufacturers no longer distinguish the two in their downhill oriented products. Freeride bikes have ample suspension and typically have at least 7 inches (180 mm) of travel. Freeride bikes are intended for trail features with large air time, such as jumps and drops, and as such are designed to handle heavy impacts, whether from landings or crashes. Freeride frames and parts are rarely made from carbon fiber due to strength and durability concerns, and are instead usually made from aluminium, sacrificing marginal weight gain for more predictable material response under heavy usage. Certain freeride specific bikes can be ridden uphill more easily than downhill bikes, but are inefficient in pedaling and difficult to maneuver while angled uphill. Originally, freeride bikes sat between All-Mountain and downhill bikes in geometry, with frame angles steeper than those found in downhill bikes and higher rider positioning, enhancing maneuverability on technical or low-speed features commonly found on "North Shore" style trails. Freeride bikes typically range in weight from 14 to 20 kilograms (31 to 44 lb), with the wide variability resulting from the variety of components applicable for the purpose. Slopestyle and Dirt Jump bikes are included in this category by some, due to similar purposes, but the distinction in bike design is significant between the three.
