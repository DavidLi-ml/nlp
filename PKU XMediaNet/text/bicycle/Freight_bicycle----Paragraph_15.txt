Longtails have a longer than usual frame wheelbase at the rear compared to a standard bicycle. The extended rear better facilitates use as a freight bicycle or carrying multiple or adult passengers compared with shorter bicycles. They tend to handle more like regular bikes than cargo bikes with linkage steering.
