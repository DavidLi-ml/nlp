Slopestyle (SS) bikes are a strange blend of Dirt Jump and Freeride bikes, having geometry similar to Dirt Jumpers, but with approximately 4" (100mm) of suspension travel in both the front and rear. These bikes are mostly used by professional slopestyle riders, this specific usage being their origin, and as such are designed for the extremely large jumps and high speeds encountered in competition. The frames are either adapted from existing All-Mountain or Freeride designs, or designed specifically for the purpose, with durable frame designs and sophisticated suspension linkages to make the most of their minimal suspension travel. These bikes usually have relatively slack head angles relative to their short suspension travel, with a slightly more aggressive overall geometry than the Dirt Jumpers many are based on. These bikes are often equipped with a mix of Dirt Jump and All-Mountain interface specifications (headset size, bottom bracket style, rear axle width and diameter, rear derailleur hanger) to accommodate both Freeride and Dirt Jump components as necessary to handle the high speeds and harsh impacts associated with their use. Slopestyle bikes are also used for light downhill or trail riding by many, if not riding jumps on the same scale as professional riders, with their durability and sophisticated suspension designs allowing for extra versatility when compared to Dirt Jump bikes.
