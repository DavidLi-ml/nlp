Dirt jumping, urban and street mountain bikes lie somewhere in between a BMX bike and a freeride bike. They are either arranged as rigid or hardtail bikes, with 3 to 4.5 inches (76 to 114 mm) of front suspension, and rigid, durable frames with low bottom brackets and short chainstays to improve maneuverability. Dirt Jump bikes often overlap in design with Four-Cross bikes, though that discipline has largely fallen out of favor, with many frames including removable derailleur hangers and/or integrated chain tensioners to allow for single speed and multi-speed arrangements (Four-Cross bikes mostly use derailleurs while Dirt Jumpers usually use single speed setups). Tires on these bikes are usually 24 or 26" diameter, fast-rolling slicks or semi-slicks, with narrow casings (approx. 1.8-2.2"). Dirt jumpers usually have low seatposts and oversized handlebars, to make room for tricks. Most dirt jumpers have an extended rear brake cable installed and have no front brake, which allows the rider to spin the handle bars multiple times without tangling the brake cables.
