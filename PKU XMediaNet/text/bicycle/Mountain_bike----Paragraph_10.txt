"Trail" Bikes are a development of XC bikes that are generally used by recreational mountain bikers either at purpose built "trail centers" or on natural off-road trails. They usually have around 5" (120–140 mm) of travel, weigh 11 to 15 kilograms (24 to 33 lb), and have geometries situated somewhere between full XC and All-Mountain bikes. Examples include the Giant Trance, the Trek Fuel EX series, the Specialized Stumpjumper FSR, and Polygon Collosus T Series, among many others. With less of an emphasis on weight, Trail Bikes are typically built to handle rougher terrain than dedicated XC bikes while having slacker head angles (69-68°) which provides greater stability while descending. Trail bikes are designed for approximately 60-70% uphill, and 30-40% downhill riding.
