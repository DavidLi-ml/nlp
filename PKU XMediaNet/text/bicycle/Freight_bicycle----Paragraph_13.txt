The Long John Bicycle is a freight bicycle with the cargo area in front of the rider and some linkage connecting the steering to the front wheel. Capacity is usually about 220 pounds (100 kg). A traditional Long John will have a smaller front wheel and a 23 or 26 in (58 or 66 cm) rear wheel and a 30–40 in (76–102 cm) long platform or basket located low in front of the handlebars. Vintage Long Johns are becoming collectible. Recently the term "Bakfiets" (which means "box bike" in Dutch) has sometimes been used to describe Long Johns and for cargo bikes in general. Slightly shorter versions of Long Johns are also sometimes referred to as "Cycletrucks". The last known manufacturer to still produce the original Long Johns is Monark. The history of Long John Bicycles is traced to Denmark c. 1923. The Smith & Co. Company (SCO - founded by Ivar Smith and Robert Jacobsen in Odense, Denmark 17 October 1894) was the inventor and the first to build this type of cargo bicycle. The first Long-John was presented to the public at the Wembley World Fair & Exhibition in 1924.
