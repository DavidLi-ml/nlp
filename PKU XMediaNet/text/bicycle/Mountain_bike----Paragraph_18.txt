Mountain cross or "Four-cross" (4X) is a type of racing in which four bikers race downhill on a prepared, BMX style track. These bikes generally fall under the categories of Dirt Jump or Slopestyle designs, with the main distinctions being the use of a derailleur rather than a single speed setup, or slightly slacker head angles than ordinary Dirt Jump bikes for increased stability at race speeds. Four-Cross racing has fallen in popularity recently, with the UCI removing Four-Cross from the World Cup due to excessive erosion and inconvenience caused by the purpose-built race tracks.
