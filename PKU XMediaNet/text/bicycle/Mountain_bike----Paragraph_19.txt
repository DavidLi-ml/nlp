Dual slalom (DS) is similar to Four-cross, but instead of four competing cyclists during a race, there are only two, racing in parallel lanes. The courses are in general more technical with smaller jumps than Four-cross courses. Dual Slalom races originally took place on grass slopes with gates and minimal jumps, but are now held on man-made courses. Dual slalom racers will usually use Dirt Jump, Slopestyle, or Dirt Jump bikes.
