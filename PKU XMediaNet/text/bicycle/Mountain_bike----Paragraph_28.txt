Most new mountain bikes use disc brakes. They offer much improved stopping power (less lever pressure is required providing greater braking modulation) over rim brakes under all conditions especially adverse conditions, because they are located at the center of the wheel (on the wheel hub). They therefore remain drier and cleaner than wheel rims, which are more readily soiled or damaged. The disadvantage of disc brakes is their increased cost and often greater weight. Well set up V brakes or older cantilever set-ups, under normal road conditions can be equally, if not more effective in stopping power. Disc brakes do not allow heat to build up in the tires on long descents. Instead, heat builds up in the rotor, which can become extremely hot.
