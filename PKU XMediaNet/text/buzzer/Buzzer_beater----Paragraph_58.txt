In gridiron football, a last-minute field goal (or, much more rarely, a successful fair catch kick) kicked as time expires can be described as a "buzzer beater," though no actual buzzers are used in that sport and a quarter or half ends upon completion of a play unless a compliant defensive penalty occurs, which gives the offense one final play, an instance that led to the Green Bay Packers' 2015 "Miracle in Motown" play against the Detroit Lions. Several important games have been decided on the outcome of buzzer beaters, such as Super Bowl XXXVI and Super Bowl XXXVIII, both of which were decided on successful kicks by Adam Vinatieri; in contrast, Scott Norwood's infamous missed kick in Super Bowl XXV decided that game in favor of the opposing New York Giants.
