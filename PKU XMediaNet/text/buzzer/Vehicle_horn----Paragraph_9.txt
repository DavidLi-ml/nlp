Locomotives have train horns, which are air horns operated by compressed air from the train's air brake system. To distinguish their sound from truck air horns, train horns in the U.S. consist of groups of two to five horns (called "chimes") which have different notes, sounded together to form a chord. Trains typically cannot stop in time to avoid hitting obstructions and depend on being seen by the driver, so they rely on their horns to warn of their approach. Therefore, train horns are louder and lower in frequency than car horns, so that they can be heard at longer distances. The sound level is 146â€“175 dB. In the US, train horns are required to have a minimum sound level of 96 dB and a maximum sound level of 110 dB at 100 ft in front of the train.
