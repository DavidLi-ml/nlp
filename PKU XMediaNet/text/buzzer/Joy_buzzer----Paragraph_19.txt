A common misconception is that the joy buzzer actually delivers an electric shock, and many stylized villains in fiction (e.g. Batman's nemesis The Joker) employ "lethally powerful" joy buzzers as weapons. Another example is in the SpongeBob SquarePants episode "Pranks a Lot" wherein Patrick Star's hand is shocked by a joy buzzer, and in The Simpsons episode "Homie the Clown", where Homer Simpson is shocked with it multiple times by Krusty the Clown to the point where he is tortured by it. However, a shocking pen does generate a mild electric shock when a victim presses the button on top; the pen can be turned to make it release the point.
