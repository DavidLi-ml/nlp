The joy buzzer was invented in 1928 by Soren Sorensen Adams of the S.S. Adams Co. It was modeled after another product, The Zapper, which was similar to the joy buzzer, but did not have a very effective buzz and contained a button that had a blunt point which would hurt the person whose hand was shaken.
