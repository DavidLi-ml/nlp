On August 15, 2004, in the first game of the Olympic Games, after a run of Alejandro Montecchia, Emanuel Ginobili received the ball trailing 82â€“81 against Serbia and Montenegro with 0.7 seconds left. He made the shot while falling sideways after it hit the board. Argentina then would win the Gold.
