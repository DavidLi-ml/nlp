In Game 4 of the 2015 Eastern Conference Semifinals, LeBron James hit a corner 2 at the buzzer to give the Cleveland Cavaliers an 86â€“84 win against the Chicago Bulls and even the series at 2 games apiece, while Cavaliers coach David Blatt was being held back from attempting to call a timeout. The Cavs had none at the time, and the technical foul would have given Chicago a free throw and possession.
