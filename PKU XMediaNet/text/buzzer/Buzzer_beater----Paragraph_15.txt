In Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals, Gar Heard hit a buzzer beater against the Boston Celtics to tie the game at 112 and force a 3rd overtime. This was one of the many high points of the game, which the Celtics won 128â€“126. Heard's shot is one of the many reasons the NBA refers to Game 5 as "The Greatest Game Ever Played".
