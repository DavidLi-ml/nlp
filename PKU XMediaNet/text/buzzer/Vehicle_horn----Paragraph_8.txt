Truck (lorry) horns may be electrically operated and similar to car horns, but are often air horns driven by air from an air compressor, which many trucks have to operate the air brakes. The compressor forces air past a diaphragm in the horn's throat, causing it to vibrate. Such air horns are often used as trim items, with chromed straight horns mounted on top of the cab. This design may also be installed on customised automobiles, using a small electrical compressor. Usually two or more are used, some drivers go so far as to install train horns. The frequencies vary to produce a variety of different chords, but in general are lower than those of automobile horns—125–180 Hz (approximately C–G). Sound levels are approximately 117–118 decibels.
