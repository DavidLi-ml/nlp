Klaxon is a trademark for a brand of electromechanical horn or alerting device. Mainly used on cars, trains and ships, klaxon horns produce an easily identifiable sound often transcribed onomatopoeiacally in English as "awooga" or "ah-oo-gah". Like most mechanical horns, the klaxon has largely been replaced by solid-state electronic alarms, though the memorable tone itself has persisted.
