The retractable blade variety is usually found to have either a cast iron handle or, less commonly, a wooden handle. The facility to retract the blade to an optimum length serves to prevent unwanted flex to the blade should the full length of the blade be obstructed in some way. In both types the blade is typically secured by one or two holding/thumb screws.
