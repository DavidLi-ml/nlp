The sabre saw (also saber saw) is a powered or unpowered hand-held reciprocating saw. The sabre saw consists of a reciprocating cutting implement, usually a toothed blade, to chiefly cut through wood and other soft materials. It differs to a jigsaw in the form of the handle and the approach to using it which has advantages when cutting into tight crevices, but otherwise is similar in application. The lack of a sole plate, which a jigsaw possesses, significantly reduces the controllability of the sabre saw. Some would consider it a type of jigsaw, though manufacturers usually differentiate them for the reasons stated.
