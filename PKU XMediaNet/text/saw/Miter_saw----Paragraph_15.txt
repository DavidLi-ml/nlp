In the late 1980s the sliding compound miter saw was introduced which combined all the best features of the compound miter saw with sliding tubes allowing the cutter head to traverse for a much wider cut. Since then it has become the primary cross cut saw for woodworking, largely supplanting the radial arm saw. Manufacturers warn of possible electrocution when used near water or other related saws in a close proximity.
