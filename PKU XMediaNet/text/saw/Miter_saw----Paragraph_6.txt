A compound miter saw has a rotating vertical pivot allowing the cutter head & blade to be tilted (or beveled) sideways in addition to the horizontally rotating table. This allows vertical & horizontal angled cuts as well as cuts angled in both planes, such as often required in crown molding. Many compound miter saws are single action, meaning that they tilt only to one side of the vertical and not both sides. Some compound miter saws are dual action, meaning they can tilt both ways. Both saws can make identical cuts, but single action saws may require the workpiece to be flipped between cuts.
