Maintenance of the saw blade will depend on the type and or age of the tool. Older key hole saws with filed crosscut teeth will require the craftsman to manually set and sharpen the teeth by hand. For contemporary versions of the retractable blade variety replacement blades are readily available thus removing the skills, tools and time that would otherwise be required to manually sharpen the blade. Mass production of cheap throw away versions of the fixed blade type make it cost effective for exactly that and purchase a new replacement when the teeth become blunt.
