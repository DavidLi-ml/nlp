A coping saw (with the correct blade) can also be used to cut through aluminium tubing and other metal objects, though a hacksaw is much more efficient for this task. The thin blade tends to make wavy cuts in thick materials unless skill is achieved through much practice on a wide variety of materials of varying thicknesses. The stroke length before the frame strikes the material above or below is the limiting factor in the maximum thickness of material. The work becomes progressively more difficult and tiring with increasing thickness of material.
