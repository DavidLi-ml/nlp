Compass saws have a narrow, tapered blade usually ending in a sharp point, typically with eight to ten teeth per inch, but up to twenty teeth per inch for harder materials and as few as five teeth per inch for softer materials. They have a curved, light "pistol grip" handle, designed for work in confined spaces and overhead.
