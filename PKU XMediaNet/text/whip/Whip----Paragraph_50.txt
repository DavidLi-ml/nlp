On MythBusters, various capabilities of whips shown in the film Raiders of the Lost Ark were tested on the "The Busters of the Lost Myths" episode. When properly trained, it is in fact possible to disarm a pistol-wielding opponent. When there is a log above a chasm it is possible to swing across using a whip and loosen the whip after the swing, but only if the log has sufficient friction. Using a high-speed camera they were able to verify that the tip of a whip can break the speed of sound.
