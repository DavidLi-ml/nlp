According to the book The Chain Whip, this may refer to the hard whip (more akin to a truncheon than a multi-section whip) due to the ambiguity in the Chinese. "Both the hard whip and the soft whip can both be referred to simply as whip (éž­) in Chinese.". Different books make wildly differing claims about the history of the Chain Whip.
