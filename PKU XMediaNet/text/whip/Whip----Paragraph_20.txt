A pocket snake whip can be curled up small enough to fit into a large pocket, and ranges in size from 3 feet to 6 feet in length. The pocket snake whip is primarily a whip for occasional use, such as in loading cattle. Both of these types of snake whips are made with a leather shot bag running approximately three quarters of the length of the whip.
