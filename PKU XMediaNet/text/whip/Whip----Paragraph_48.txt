The whip is occasionally portrayed in popular culture in various contexts. Whips have appeared in many cartoons, television shows, videogames such as Castlevania, and numerous films, from the original Zorro to Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Catwoman (2004). Often their usage is dramatic and wildly exaggerated, showing action heroes tripping or disarming an adversary, breaking furniture, or other impressive activities.
