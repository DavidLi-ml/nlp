The second modification was done to raise the desk by adding a separate, uniform base called a plinth. The first time a base was made for the Resolute Desk was during the John F. Kennedy Administration. This base was made of pine and did not match the desk very well. That base is very visible in the famous photo of John F. Kennedy Jr. playing under the Resolute Desk. In January 1977, President Carter requested the desk be sent back to the White House from the Smithsonian Institution. Photos from Januaryâ€“February 1977 show the Resolute Desk being used with a base, but the base had been removed by late May of that year, when it was photographed without it. White House record photos from early in Ronald Reagan's presidency, one as late as October 23, 1981, show the desk being used without a base. President Reagan requested that the desk be raised higher since he was hitting his legs on the top of the knee hole. The White House's earliest image of the desk with a base during the Reagan Administration is dated August 13, 1982. A new, better-fitting base was built for the desk in 1986, and that base has remained with the desk since that time.
