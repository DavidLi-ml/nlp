"The design for the secretaire is the work of a working-joiner employed at the dockyard at Chatham. England, where the Resolute was broken up. The top is covered with morocco, bordered and embossed. The front panels contained carved medallion portraits of Her Majesty and the President of the United States; the side panels , Arctic subjects, also in relief; and the space at the back of the table, corresponding with the front panels, is furnished with a set of six drawers on either side, the handles of which are formed by two hands- male and female â€“ grasping each other, symbolic of the goodwill existing between the heads of the two countries. The top cornices of the eight corner pedestals were appropriated to carved representations of the Arctic and Antarctic circles and the American and English flags crossed, while busts of celebrated arctic explorers support the cornices.
