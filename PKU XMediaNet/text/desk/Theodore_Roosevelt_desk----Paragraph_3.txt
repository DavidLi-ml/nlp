The desk was designed by architect Charles Follen McKim, who made extensive renovations to the White House during the Theodore Roosevelt Administration. It was made by furniture-maker A. H. Davenport and Company, of Boston, Massachusetts. Roosevelt was the first U.S. president to use the desk, placing it in the Executive Office of the newly built West Wing.
