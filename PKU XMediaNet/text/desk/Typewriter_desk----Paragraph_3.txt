Originally, typewriters were very costly machines which one tried to protect from dust or accidents. They were also very ungainly or even ugly to those unfamiliar with them, and getting them out of sight was useful for aesthetic reasons. Therefore early typewriter desks often had some method for hiding the typewriter or getting it out of the way within the desk, sometimes by swivelling it or turning it.
