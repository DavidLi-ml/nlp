After Resolute was broken up, Queen Victoria asked for several desks to be built from her timbers. Four desks were designed and made by William Evenden. A large partners desk was presented to President Rutherford B. Hayes on 23 November 1880, while a smaller lady's desk was presented to the widow of Henry Grinnell; this desk is now in the New Bedford Whaling Museum. Finally, the Queen had two desks made for herself: one is a small writing table catalogued online (with a photograph showing its plaque) . It is now on loan to the National Museum of the Royal Navy Portsmouth, and the second a smaller writing table, which she had made for her private yacht, HMY Victoria and Albert II. {The National Museum of the Royal Navy states that it has a record that it received a table from this yacht "in poor condition" but has no further information and that this table's whereabouts are now unknown.
