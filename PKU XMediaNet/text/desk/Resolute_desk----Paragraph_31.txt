Replicas of the Resolute desk have appeared in many movies. The desk was a key plot device in National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets, in which a secret compartment in the desk contained pieces of a clue to the location of treasure. The film also features another desk made from HMS Resolute, situated in Buckingham Palace, which was made for the personal use of Queen Victoria.
