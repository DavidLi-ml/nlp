As a matter of course in the Royal Navy, all captains who lost ships were tried by Courts-Martial. And so Belcher was tried by court-martial for abandoning the four seaworthy vessels, as were Resolute's captain, Henry Kellett; Intrepid 's commander, Francis Leopold McClintock; and Pioneer 's commander, Sherard Osborn. All were acquitted. Belcher, however, never received another commission and was scorned by the officers of his Court-Martial when they returned his sword to him in complete silence. Resolute continued to move slowly eastward in the pack ice, and one year later in the autumn of 1855 she was 1200 miles away from the place where she had been abandoned. In September 1855 an American whaler named James Buddington, from New London, CT saw Resolute adrift in the pack ice off Cape Walsingham in Davis Strait. He split his crew and sailed her back to New London, arriving home on Christmas Eve. Buddington's ship, George Henry, had preceded Resolute, and many were beginning to wonder if Buddington was still alive. The British government waived all claims to the ship upon learning of its arrival in New London.
