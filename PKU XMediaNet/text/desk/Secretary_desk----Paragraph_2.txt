When closed, the secretary desk looks like a cross between a commode-dresser, a slant top desk and a book case. The secretary is one of the most common antique desk forms and has been endlessly reproduced and copied for home use in the last hundred years. Among home desk forms, it is the tallest, biggest and heaviest, excluding wall units and modular desks which typically can be disassembled for moving, or some of the biggest of the armoire desks, which are usually delivered unassembled.
