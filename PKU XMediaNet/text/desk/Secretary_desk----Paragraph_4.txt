When a secretary desk is cut in half vertically, so to speak, to provide a secretary desk half as wide as usual on one side and a glassed door cabinet on the other, this big piece of furniture is called a side-by-side secretary. The term is also applied sometimes to very big pieces of furniture made up of three elements, one of them being a half-wide secretary desk. Until recently there was a good example of a side-by-side secretary in the second floor office of the historic home of John Muir in Martinez, California. The attic of this home also had a good example of a portable desk.
