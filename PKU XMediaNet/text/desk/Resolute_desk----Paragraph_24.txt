President John F. Kennedy first placed it in the Oval Office in 1961. Some presidents, such as George H. W. Bush, have used the desk in their private study rather than the Oval Office. The desk left the White House from 1963 until President Carter brought it back to the Oval Office. Since then, former presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and the current president Barack Obama have used it in the Oval Office.
