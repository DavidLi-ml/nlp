The National Maritime Museumâ€™s Sep 9th, 1879 design plans are drawings for two different gifts proposed by the Admiralty but never executed, a "Secretaire" and a "Library Table". The Library Table and the President's Secretaire were never implemented and these proposed gifts were replaced with the William Evenden's 1880 Resolute Desk. The Evenden Desk delivered to President Hayes does not accord with the plan held at Greenwich except for the order imperative that it 'be made from the timbers of the late Arctic Ship "Resolute" .
