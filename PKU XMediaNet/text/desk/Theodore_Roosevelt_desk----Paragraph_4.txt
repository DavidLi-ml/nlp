Roosevelt's successor, President William Howard Taft, doubled the size of the West Wing and built its first Oval Office. He placed the desk at the south end of the room, in front of the three windows. It remained there for over twenty years, and was subsequently used by Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover.
