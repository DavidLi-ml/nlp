The West Wing suffered a major fire on December 24, 1929, but the desk was undamaged. An association of Grand Rapids, Michigan furniture-makers donated a new desk, and President Hoover used that for the remainder of his term. President Franklin D. Roosevelt demolished the old Oval Office in 1933, and built the modern one. He used the Hoover desk in both offices. The Theodore Roosevelt desk remained in storage from December 1929 to 1945.
