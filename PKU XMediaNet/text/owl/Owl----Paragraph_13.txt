Most owls are nocturnal, actively hunting their prey in darkness. Several types of owl, however, are crepuscularâ€”active during the twilight hours of dawn and dusk; one example is the pygmy owl (Glaucidium). A few owls are active during the day also; examples are the burrowing owl (Speotyto cunicularia) and the short-eared owl (Asio flammeus).
