Another popular theory suggests that females have not been selected to be smaller like male owls because of their sexual roles. In many species, female owls may not leave the nest. Therefore, females may have a larger mass to allow them to go without starving for a longer period of time. For example, one hypothesized sexual role is that larger females are more capable of dismembering prey and feeding it to their young, hence why female owls are larger than their male counterparts.
