Sexual dimorphism is a physical difference between males and females of a species. Reverse sexual dimorphism is when females are larger than males and it has been observed across multiple owl species. The degree of size dimorphism varies across multiple populations and species, and is measured through various traits, such as wing span and body mass. Overall, female owls tend to be slightly larger than males. The exact explanation for this development in owls is unknown. However, there are several theories explaining the development of sexual dimorphism in owls.
