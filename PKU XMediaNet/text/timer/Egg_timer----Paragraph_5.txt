Most traditional egg timers have a set time of about three minutes, that being the approximate time it takes to cook an average-sized hen's egg in water. Hard-boiled eggs take longer to cook. The three-minute egg timer is for soft-boiled eggs.  The egg changes rapidly during the first few minutes of cooking. The changes cannot be seen through the eggshell, so timing is important.
