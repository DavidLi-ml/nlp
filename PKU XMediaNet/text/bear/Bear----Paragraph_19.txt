The mitochondrial DNA of brown bears of Alaska's ABC Islands is more closely related to polar bears than to brown bears elsewhere in the world. This is because of repeated historical interbreeding between polar bears and brown bears on the islands. Also, the very rare Tibetan blue bear is a type of brown bear. Koalas are often referred to as bears due to their appearance; however, they are marsupials, not bears.
