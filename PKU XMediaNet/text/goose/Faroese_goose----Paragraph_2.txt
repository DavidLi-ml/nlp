In winter, the geese move freely in the cultivated infields of the villages. In some villages, the infield is of such good quality that earlier the geese did not even need complementary feed in the winter. However, in most places there is given complementary food when there is snow, and just before and during egg laying. The properties that the Faroese goose have today, is the result of natural selection over centuries, where only the most hardy and frugal birds have managed to get offspring.
