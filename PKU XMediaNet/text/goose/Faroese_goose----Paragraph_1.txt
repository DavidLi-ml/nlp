Since the Faroe Islands have no predator that can kill the geese, there has developed a special "goose culture" in the Faroe Islands, which has no equivalent in neighboring countries. From May to October there can be seen flocks of geese walk freely in the outfields, where they feed on the short summer grass, without any supplementary feeding.
