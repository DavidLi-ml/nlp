Canada geese are susceptible to avian bird flus, such as H5N1. A study was carried out using the HPAI virus, a H5N1 virus, the results found that the geese are susceptible to the virus and proved useful for monitoring the spread of the virus, attributed to the high mortality of the infected birds. Prior exposure to other viruses may result in some resistance to H5N1.
