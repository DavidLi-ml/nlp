Like a few other goose breeds, including the Pilgrim and Cotton Patch, Shetlands are sexually dimorphic (called auto-sexing in poultry nomenclature), and can be differentiated on appearance alone. Ganders have entirely white plumage, while geese have a head, neck, and upper body with gray highlights and a white underbody. They generally mate for life, and are good parents. Shetland geese lay around 30 eggs a year, that are white in colour. The Shetland goose has a shorter bill, due to its natural ability to forage.
