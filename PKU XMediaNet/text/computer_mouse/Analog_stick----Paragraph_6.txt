Sony's PSP has been criticized for the lack of a second analog "nub" to accompany the left-hand one, a criticism that was later also leveled at Nintendo's 3DS. Nintendo has since released an add-on for the 3DS that adds, among other things, a second analog "circle pad". The follow-up to the PSP, the PlayStation Vita, features dual analog sticks. It is the first handheld game console to do so. The New Nintendo 3DS and New Nintendo 3DS XL added a second analog controller, known as the "C-Stick" to the right side of the device.
