The online Oxford Dictionaries entry for mouse states the plural for the small rodent is mice, while the plural for the small computer connected device is either mice or mouses. The dictionary's usage section states that the more common plural is mice and claims the first recorded use of the plural is mice (though it cites a 1984 use of mice when there were actually several earlier ones, such as J. C. R. Licklider's "The Computer as a Communication Device" of 1968). According to the fifth edition of The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language the plural can be either "mice" or "mouses".
