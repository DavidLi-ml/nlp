This was the first Apple mouse to use an LED for fully solid-state optical tracking instead of a rubber ball. It was included as the standard mouse with all shipping desktop Macs and was later made available in white. However, in 2003 it underwent a minor redesign, during which time the black version was discontinued, and Pro was dropped from its name.
