Initially announced for release on April 21, 1996, Nintendo released their Nintendo 64 controller on June 23, 1996 in Japan. The new controller included a thumb-operated control stick which, while a digital stick (the stick operated on the same principles as a mechanical computer mouse), still allowed for varying levels of movement and near-360-degree control, translating into far more precise movements than were possible with a D-pad.
