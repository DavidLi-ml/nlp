Like many earlier products (see SuperDrive) Apple re-used the name Apple Mouse briefly after the Pro Mouse was discontinued. As for the recent Apple Keyboard models, Apple did continue to use the Apple Mouse name for its subsequent model releases: the Apple Mighty Mouse of 2005 has been renamed Apple Mouse circa 2012.
