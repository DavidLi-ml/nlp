By 1982 the Xerox 8010 was probably the best-known computer with a mouse, and the forthcoming Apple Lisa was rumored to use one, but the peripheral remained obscure; Jack Hawley of The Mouse House reported that one buyer for a large organization believed at first that his company sold lab mice. Hawley, who manufactured mice for Xerox, stated that "Practically, I have the market all to myself right now"; a Hawley mouse cost $415. That year Microsoft made the decision to make the MS-DOS program Microsoft Word mouse-compatible, and developed the first PC-compatible mouse. Microsoft's mouse shipped in 1983, thus beginning Microsoft hardware. However, the mouse remained relatively obscure until the 1984 appearance of the Macintosh 128K, which included an updated version of the Lisa Mouse and the Atari ST in 1985.
