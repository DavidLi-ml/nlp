Its use is prevalent in 3D games, where more than 8 directions are needed (which is all that was offered on the d-pad). Using a D-pad in a 3D game greatly limits the ability to move. For example, in a 3D platform game like Super Mario 64, using a D-pad would allow Mario to move forward, left, and forward-left, but nothing in between. Some early 3D games such as Resident Evil overcame this limitation by assigning the Left and Right directions on the D-pad to spin the character instead of making the character move in that direction. This, however, created its own problems as the character was unable to move while spinning, requiring the player to stand in the same spot while changing direction; commonly referred to as "tank controls". With the prevalence of analog sticks, the aforementioned limitations of the D-pad ceased to be an issue.
