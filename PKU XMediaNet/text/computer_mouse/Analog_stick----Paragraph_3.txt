Two analog sticks offer greater functionality than a single stick. On some modern game controllers, the left stick is positioned to the upper left of the D-pad while the right stick is positioned to the lower left of the face buttons. First-party controllers with this configuration include the Nintendo GameCube controller, Xbox controller, Xbox 360 controller and Xbox One controller.
