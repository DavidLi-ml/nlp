In 1989 Sega would later release an analog thumbstick controller for the Mega Drive. Called the XE-1 AP, The new controller included a thumb-operated control stick which allowed for varying levels of movement and near-360-degree control, translating into far more precise movements than were possible with a D-pad. It also distinguished itself by having the player control it with the thumb, similar to a D-pad, rather than gripping a handle.
