Along with the changes in configuration, the body design of school buses underwent major revisions as well. Following the lead of the steel-paneled 1927 Blue Bird bus, body manufacturers abandoned wagon-style design for all-steel automotive-type design, with Wayne producing the first all-steel body in 1930. As school buses were produced on a regional basis, weather protection varied widely by manufacturer; in place of canvas curtains, the 1930 Wayne all-steel bus introduced the first bus body with safety glass windows.
