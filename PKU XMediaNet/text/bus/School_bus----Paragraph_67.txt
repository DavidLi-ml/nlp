In 1967, as part of an effort to improve crash protection in school buses, researchers at UCLA developed a new interior design for school buses that would be phased in by the end of the 1970s. Using the concept of compartmentalization, researchers raised the height of the seat backs and placed padding on both front and rear of the seatback; a key part of the design was the closer spacing of the seats to better contain student passengers in a potential crash, with each seat back spaced a maximum of 24 inches apart. In April 1977, FMVSS 222 mandated this design, replacing metal-backed seats with the thickly-padded seats seen in use today.
