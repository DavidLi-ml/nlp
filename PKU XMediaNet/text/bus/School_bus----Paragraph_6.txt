The 1930s marked a major transition in school bus design, with the vehicle gaining a distinct, dedicated form in place of the adaptation of wagons and trucks to accommodate student passengers. For the ease of loading passengers and to improve forward visibility, the entry door was relocated from the rear to the front curbside corner, replaced by a door operated by the driver. The rear door gained a new function, repurposed as an emergency exit.
