Outside North America, purpose-built vehicles for student transport are not as common. "School buses" can be a term in reference to buses in use for any bus dedicated to transporting students; the vehicles involved can be an older bus or coach retrofitted as a dedicated school bus or it can be a regular bus used for transporting students at the start and end of the school day, transporting adults during school hours and during the rest of the day.
