During the past decade, a number of changes have been made to develop a new generation of school buses; many of the changes are focused on producing environmentally-friendly vehicles. In 2009, Blue Bird introduced a propane-fueled version of its Vision conventional, becoming the first manufacturer to sell a propane-fuel school bus from the factory. In 2011, Lion Bus of Saint-Jérôme, Quebec marked the return of full-size bus production to Canada. In partnership with Spartan Motors, Lion was the first all-new manufacturer of full-size school buses in 19 years. Lion has a single conventional-style school bus; in an unusual move to combat corrosion, its body was designed primarily with composite panels in place of the traditionally-used steel. In 2014, a battery-operated version of the Lion made its debut with a CNG-fueled version debuting in 2015.
