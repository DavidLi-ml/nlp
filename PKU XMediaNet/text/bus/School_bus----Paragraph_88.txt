Some retired school buses are converted into recreational vehicles (RVs); enthusiasts of this type of vehicle conversion, as well as the vehicles themselves, are sometimes called skoolies (or schoolies). The more primitively equipped 1946 International Harvester school bus abandoned on the Stampede Trail in which Christopher McCandless lived and died, in 1992 (often referred to as the "Magic School Bus"), is used as lodging for hikers and hunters in Alaska. Since McCandless' death, the bus has become a pilgrimage destination for trekkers who camp at the vehicle. (See Christopher_McCandless#Legacy.)
