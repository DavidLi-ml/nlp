Bus is a clipped form of the Latin word omnibus. It appeared in Paris in 1819–20 as (voiture) omnibus meaning "(carriage) for all", and appeared in London in 1829. One etymology holds that omnibus is derived from a hatter's shop which was situated in front of one of the first bus stations in Nantes, France in 1823. "Omnes Omnibus" was a pun on the Latin-sounding name of that hatter Omnès: omnes means "all" and omnibus means (among other things) "for all" in Latin. Nantes citizens soon gave the nickname Omnibus to the vehicle.
