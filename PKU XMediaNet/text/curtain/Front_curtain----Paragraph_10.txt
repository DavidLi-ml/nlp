The tableau, tab, or tabbed curtain, also called opera drapes, though iconic of the theater setting, is the rarest of curtains to actually be employed on the stage. It consists of two overlapping panels (often but not always pleated) secured along the top to a batten, with the lower onstage corners or center points of the panel edges attached to lines or cables. These lines run through series of rings behind each curtain diagonally, and then through pulleys in the batten and down to the floor. When the cord is pulled, the fabric is lifted diagonally up and out, away from the center. In this position, it does not fully clear the stage, instead creating a frilled tent-like viewing frame for the performanceâ€“ it is because of this tendency to limit the audience's view that it is rarely used except in very small venues. However, as the top of the curtain never moves, it requires no track (like a traveler curtain) and as the curtain itself is never actually raised, neither does it require any sandbag counterweights (like an oleo or an Austrian).
