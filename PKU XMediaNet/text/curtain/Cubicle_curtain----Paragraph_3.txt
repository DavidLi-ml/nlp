Cubicle curtains have been known to cause HAI’s (Hospital Acquired Infections). Studies have found methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on cubicle curtains in hospitals. Since the exposure of this phenomenon, some medical treatment facilities have begun to use anti-microbial curtains in an effort to impede the spread of HAI's.
