In its most-basic form, a drape or curtain bind often consists of a ring and a pin: the curtain is "bound" inside the ring by the placement of the pin behind it, holding the curtain in the center of the window rather than along its edge as with most tie-backs. Alternatively, a double-slotted piece of wood or plastic resembling a figure-8 can be used to the same effect. This arrangement is only possible with very brief or sheer curtains.
