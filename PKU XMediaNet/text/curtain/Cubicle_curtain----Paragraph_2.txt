Cubicle curtain design underwent a period of rapid growth in the 1990s. Instead of traditional solids and tone-on-tones, a broader range of subtle colors, muted tones, and soft hues became available along with different textures and more elaborate patterns. Nature themed cubicle curtains are popular as well as customizable options.
