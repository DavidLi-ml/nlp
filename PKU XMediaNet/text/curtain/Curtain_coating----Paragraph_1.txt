Curtain coating is a process in which the object or substrate to be coated is guided through a curtain of fluid located in a gap between two conveyors. The mechanism is formed by a tank of fluid from which a thin screen falls down in between the two conveyors. The thickness of the coating layer that falls upon the object is mainly determined by the speed of the conveyor and the amount of material leaving the tank (pump speed). Curtain coating is a premetered method, which means that the amount of liquid required is supplying from the tank to the screen, to be deposited on the substrate.
