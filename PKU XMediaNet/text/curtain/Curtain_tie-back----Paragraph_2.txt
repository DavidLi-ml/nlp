A structured tie-back consists of a single short U-shaped strip of fabric held flat by a piece of interfacing. A ring (often metal, sometimes wood or plastic) is placed at each end of the strip, and the strip is looped around the curtain to hold it in the open position. Both rings are then hung on a peg or hook on a nearby frame or wall.
