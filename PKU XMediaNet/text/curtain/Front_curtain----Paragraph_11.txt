The Venetian curtain, also known as a profile or contour curtain, has multiple vertical lines distributed across the length of the single panel of fabric, which is usually made with as much as 200% fullness and must be thin and soft so it gathers well. The curtain is opened by pulling on the lines. Each line is independently operated, making it possible to control the shape and height of curtain openings. This type of curtain is typically the most difficult type to operate because of the many independent lines.
