Tassels are among the most common form of soft furnishing tie-backs. A tassel tie-back may consist of a single or paired set of tassels connected to a rope or braid with either one or two loops. These loops are secured around the curtain in the same way as the other soft furnishing tie-backs, or the loops may be tied to each other in a loose knot. Depending on the length of the cord, the number of loops, and the number of tassels, several other arrangements are also possible, including some where a tassel is run through a loop or where the curtain is hung inside the loop and the loop is cinched into place by a large bead or a slip knot. The length of rope beyond the cinch bead is referred to as the embrace and must be long enough to comfortably but securely hold the curtain. Too long an embrace and the curtain hangs too much in the window, blocking the view. Too short, and the curtain appears bunched up when secured.
