A curtain tie-back is a decorative window treatment which accompanies a cloth curtain. Within the field of interior decoration, tie-backs made of fabric are classified as a kind of "soft furnishing" (along with other fabric-based d√©cor such as pillows, valances, towels, blankets, mattresses, bed skirts, bedspreads, jabots, and shower and window curtains) while those made out of wood, metal, or glass are considered "window hardware" (along with curtain rods, cornices, latches, hinges, push bars, and handles).
