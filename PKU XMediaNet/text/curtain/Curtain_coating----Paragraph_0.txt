Curtain coating is a process that creates an uninterrupted curtain of fluid that falls onto a substrate. The substrate is transported on a conveyor belt at a regulated speed through the curtain to ensure an even coat of the die. The curtain is created by using a slit at the base of the holding tank, allowing the liquid to fall upon the substrate. Most manufactures will also include a catch pan to retrieve and reuse the excess fluid.
