An olio (or oleo ) drop, also called an olio curtain, roll drop, or simply an olio (though never an olio drape), consists of a single large canvas called a drop, which is attached at the bottom to a long rigid tube. The canvas is often decorated with a mural. Olio curtains were popular in vaudeville theatre as they require a minimum of overhead space, were simple to construct, and in most cases could be operated by a single person.
