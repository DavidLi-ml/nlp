A variation on the Austrian is the waterfall curtain: in this version, instead of horizontal festoons, the curtain has vertical pleats like a traditional theater curtain, but it still gathers from the bottom in a number of swags. The waterfall has a pipe batten along the bottom edge to ensure the lines rise evenly.
