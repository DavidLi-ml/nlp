The technology used in new installations depends on a variety of factors. Hydraulic elevators are cheaper, but installing cylinders greater than a certain length becomes impractical for very-high lift hoistways. For buildings of much over seven storeys, traction elevators must be employed instead. Hydraulic elevators are usually slower than traction elevators.
