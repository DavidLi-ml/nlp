In the game of cricket, the cricket pitch consists of the central strip of the cricket field between the wickets â€“ 1 chain or 20.12 m (22 yards) long and 3.05 m (10 feet) wide. The surface is flat and normally covered with extremely short grass though this grass is soon removed by wear at the ends of the pitch.
