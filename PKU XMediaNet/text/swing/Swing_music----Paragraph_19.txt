Presley's hit "Are You Lonesome Tonight" was a swing standard and Lewis's "To Make Love Sweeter For You" was a new song in the old style. Domino made the swing standard "My Blue Heaven" into a rock and roll hit. Shep Fields was among the band leaders of the 1930s and 1940s whose performances included elements of both "Sweet Band" music and traditional swing.
