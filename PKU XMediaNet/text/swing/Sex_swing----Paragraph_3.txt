The most common sex swing is similar to a hammock and holds the receptive partner in a supine position (back down). A variant of the hammock style is a hanging platform of wood or metal, padded for comfort, on which the receptive partner reclines. The hanging platform differs from the hammock style in that, being rigid, the receptive partner's back is straight rather than bowed. Both the hammock and hanging platform designs are often equipped with loops or stirrups to support the ankles or calves up without the requiring exertion by the receptive partner. This allows the receptive partner's hips to be flexed without exertion, improving access to the areas of interest.
