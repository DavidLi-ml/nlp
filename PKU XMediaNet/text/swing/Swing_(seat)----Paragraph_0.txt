A swing is a hanging seat, often found at playgrounds for children including adults, at circus for acrobats, or on a porch for relaxing, although they may also be items of indoor furniture, such as the Indian oonjal. The seat of a swing may be suspended from chains or ropes. Once a swing is in motion it continues to oscillate like a pendulum until external interference or drag brings it to a halt. Swing sets are very popular with children.
