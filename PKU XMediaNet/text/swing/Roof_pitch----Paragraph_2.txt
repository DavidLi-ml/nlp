The pitch matters for a variety of reasons including the type of roofing material used, walkability, proportions to the building as a whole which is sometimes a critical factor in some architectural styles such as a steep pitch in Gothic architecture and a low pitch in Classical architecture, and combinations of pitches form distinctive roof shapes such as a gambrel roof. The basic ranges of pitch are not uniformly defined but range from flat, which are not perfectly flat but sloped to drain water up to 1/2:12 to 2:12; low-slope roofing requires special materials and techniques to avoid leaks and ranges from 1:12 (2:12) to 4:12; conventional from 4:12 to 9:12; and steep-slope roofing is above 9:12 (21:12) and may require extra fasteners.
