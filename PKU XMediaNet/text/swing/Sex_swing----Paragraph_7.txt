Sex swings can enable individuals with a physical impairment or disability to enjoy a wide range of sexual activities. Individuals with muscular weakness or arthritis may use a sex swing to reduce the strain on affected muscles or joints. Individuals who use a wheelchair can engage in sexual activity using a sex swing suspended from a hoist.
