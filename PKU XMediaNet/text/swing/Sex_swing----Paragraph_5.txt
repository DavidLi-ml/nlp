Another variation is the sit swing, which holds the receptive partner upright in sitting position, rather than supine. Sit swings take most of the body's weight with large padded loops around the thighs, or some similar arrangement. Sit swings are commonly suspended from a single point attached to the ceiling, to a free-standing sex swing stand, or a door. Door swings offer quicker installation and lower cost, but sacrifice some flexibility.
