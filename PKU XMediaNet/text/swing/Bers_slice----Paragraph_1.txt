For a quasi-Fuchsian group. the limit set is a Jordan curve whose complement has two components. The quotient of each of these components by the groups is a Riemann surface, so we get a map from marked quasi-Fuchsian groups to pairs of Riemann surfaces, and hence to a product of two copies of Teichmüller space. A Bers slice is a subset of the moduli space of quasi-Fuchsian groups for which one of the two components of this map is a constant function to a single point in its copy of Teichmüller space.
