The styles of jazz that were popular in the 1920s were usually played with a two-beat "feel", and often attempted to reproduce the style of contrapuntal improvisation developed by jazz musicians in New Orleans. In the late 1920s bigger ensembles using written arrangements became the norm. Rhythm developed a four-beat feel, with a smoothly syncopated style of playing the melody while the rhythm section supported it with a steady four-to-the-bar. Many bassists were unsure of what to do with these extra beats, and thus commonly played each note twice. This led to the sound of doubled notes becoming an indication of a swing bass line.
