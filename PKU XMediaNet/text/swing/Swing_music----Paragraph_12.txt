A typical song played in swing style would feature a strong, anchoring rhythm section in support of more loosely-tied wind, brass. During the swing era, string or vocal sections, or both, were also common. The level of improvisation that the audience might expect varied with the arrangement, song, band, and band-leader. The most common style consisted of a soloist taking center stage and improvising while his bandmates played support. As a song progressed, multiple soloists would take over and improvise their parts. It was not unusual to have two or three band members improvising at any one time.
