The pitch is protected to preserve fairness in the game. Whenever a bowler follows through on the pitch, it creates patches in the dirt that cause unpredictable swing and bounce. These areas can be exploited by the bowlers to change the outcome of the match. If a bowler runs on the protected area, an umpire will issue a warning to the bowler and to his team captain. The umpire issues a second and final warning if the bowler transgresses again. On the third offence, the umpire will eject the bowler from the attack and the bowler may not bowl again for the remainder of the innings.
