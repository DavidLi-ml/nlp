A sex swing or sling is designed to assist in sexual activity. Materials for constructing these devices include nylon webbing, heavy canvas, leather, neoprene, heavy rubber, wood,and steel. The designs provide access to the passive (receptive) partner's genitalia, perineum, buttocks, and anal areas while supporting the individual in a comfortable position, with the hips flexed, to allowing the passive partner to fully relax.
