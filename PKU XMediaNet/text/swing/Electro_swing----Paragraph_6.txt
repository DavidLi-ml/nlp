On December 9, 2015, Vice Media's electronic music channel Thump published an article by Angus Harrison with its title calling electro swing the "Worst Genre of Music in the World, Ever." A major criticism in the article included how electro swing nightclubs use the genre's combination of sounds popular in older eras with today's contemporary dance elements as a selling point, even though all other sample-based electronic styles have done the same thing. Harrison labeled electro swing as "the sonic equivalent of "ye olde fashioned barber" in East London," also strongly disliking its image consisting of vintage parts of culture from the 1930s and 1940s awkwardly put together and overly used with modern-day trends. The article garnered extremely negative responses from the electro swing fan base.
