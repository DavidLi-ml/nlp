The UAE features spin-friendly pitches. New ball helps the bowlers and bowlers eye reverse swing and spin with the older ball. UAE conditions differ significantly from those of Pakistan due to the Gulf's sandy soils. Bowlers with a straight arm action like Johan Botha tend to reap wickets at these pitches. Grounds are not that hard. Dubai Cricket Stadium offers some grass, and fast bowlers like Shoaib Akhtar loop the ball on to the ground. Sheikh Zayed Stadium is batting-friendly, and the cracks come very late into play.
