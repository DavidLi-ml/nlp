Hammock-style swings vary in the number of suspension points from three (two at the hips and one at the head), to four (two at the hips and two at the shoulders), to five (two each at hips and shoulders, plus one at the head). The functional difference between these variants lies in the stability of the sling when in use: the more suspension points, the less movement. However, many users prefer to have a greater range of movement.
