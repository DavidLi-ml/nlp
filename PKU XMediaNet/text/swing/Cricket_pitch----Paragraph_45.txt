Unlike in baseball, the word pitch does not refer to the act of propelling the ball towards the batsman in cricket. Cricket fans usually refer to this action as a ball or as a delivery. (Also, the word ball does not imply anything about the accuracy of the delivery. In baseball, by contrast, a ball is a pitch that both fails to enter the strike zone and is not swung at by the batter.)
