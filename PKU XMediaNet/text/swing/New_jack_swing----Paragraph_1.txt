Merriam-Webster's online dictionary defines new jack swing as "pop music usually performed by black musicians that combines elements of traditional jazz, electronica, smooth jazz, funk, rap, and rhythm and blues." Encyclopædia Britannica calls it the "most pop-oriented rhythm-and-blues music since 1960s Motown," since its "performers were unabashed entertainers, free of artistic pretensions; its songwriters and producers were commercial professionals." New jack swing did not take up the trend of using sampled beats, and instead created beats using the then-new SP-1200 sampler and Roland TR-808 drum machine to lay an "insistent beat under light melody lines and clearly enunciated vocals." Encyclopædia Britannica states that the "key producers" were Babyface, Bernard Belle, and Teddy Riley.
