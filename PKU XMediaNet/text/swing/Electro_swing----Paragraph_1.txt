The mid 90s saw a succession of hip-hop influenced records that sampled vintage swing. Many of these were one-off novelties and would not at the time have been described as electro swing. Lucas With The Lid Off (1994) by Lucas (AKA Lucas Secon) is an early example which had chart success and subsequently featured on UK TV advertising (Weetabix). Others such as Doop (1994) were minor hits, while Jimmy Luxury coined the term swing-hop with the song "Hi-Ball Swing" in (1999). Songs like Mr. Scruff's "Get A Move On" (1999), Jurassic 5's "Swing Set" (2000), Gry and F.M. Einheit's "Princess Crocodile" (2000) and The Real Tuesday Weld's "Bathtime in Clerkenwell" (2003) all built on this sound, each adding new elements. In the 90s, the artists Cajmere produced multiple house hits that were greatly influenced by swing such as "U Got Me Up". Many 'Lounge' and 'Nu-Jazz' tracks also borrowed Swing music elements. This was developed and built on by artists like G-Swing, Waldeck and Caravan Palace.
