An oral syringe is a measuring instrument used to accurately measure doses of liquid medicine which are expressed in millilitres (mL). They do not have threaded tips, because no needle or other device needs to be screwed onto them. The contents are simply squirted or sucked from the syringe directly into the mouth of the person or animal.
