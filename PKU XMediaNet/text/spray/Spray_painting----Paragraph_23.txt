Airless pumps can be powered by different types of motor: electric, compressed air (pneumatic) or hydraulic. Most have a paint pump (also called a lower) that is a double acting piston, in which the piston pumps the paint in both the down and the upstroke. Some airless pumps have a diaphragm instead of a piston, but both types have inlet and outlet valves.
