The fluid pressure is provided by an airless pump, which allows much heavier materials to be sprayed than is possible with an airspray gun. Compressed air is introduced into the spray from an airless tip (nozzle) to improve the fineness of atomisation. Some electric airless sprayers are fitted with a compressor to allow the use of an air assisted airless gun in situations where portability is important.
