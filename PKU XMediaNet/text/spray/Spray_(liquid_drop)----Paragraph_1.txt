Spray atomization can be formed by several methods. The most common method is through a spray nozzle which typically has a fluid passage that is acted upon by different mechanical forces that atomize the liquid. The first atomization nozzle was invented by Thomas A. DeVilbiss of Toledo, Ohio in the late 1800s His invention was bulb atomizer that used pressure to impinge upon a liquid, breaking the liquid into a fine mist. Spray formation has taken on several forms, the most common being, pressure sprayers, centrifugal, electrostatic and ultrasonic nozzle.
