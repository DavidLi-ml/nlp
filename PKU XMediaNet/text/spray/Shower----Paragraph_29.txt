When a person takes a shower may indicate their social position. Blue collar workers have been found to be more likely to take a shower in the evening after work, whereas white collar workers have been found to shower in the morning before work. An equal number of reasons can be offered for showering at night as for showering in the morning. Contrary to myth, there are no adverse health effects from showering at night.
