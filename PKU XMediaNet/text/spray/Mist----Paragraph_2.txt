The only difference between mist and fog is visibility. The phenomenon is called fog, if the visibility is one kilometre (1,100 yards) or less (in the UK for driving purposes the definition of fog is visibility less than 100 metres (UK Highway Code rule 226), for pilots the distance is 1 kilometre). Otherwise it is known as mist. Seen from a distance, mist is bluish, and haze is more brownish.
