The practice of Chinese archery can be referred to as The Way of Archery (Chinese: 射道; pinyin: shè dào), a term derived from the 17th century Ming Dynasty archery manuals written by Gao Ying (simplified Chinese: 高颖; traditional Chinese: 高穎; pinyin: gāo yǐng, born 1570, died ?). The use of 道 (pinyin: dào, the way) can also be seen in names commonly used for other East Asian styles, such as Japanese archery (Kyudo) and Korean archery (Gungdo).
