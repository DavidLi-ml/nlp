In Arab archery, there was the description of the use of "nockless arrows". In shooting at the enemies, either the Turks or the Persians, it was seen that the enemies would pick up the expended arrows and shoot them back at the Arabs. So they developed "nockless arrows", which would be useless to their foes. The bowstring would have a small ring that is tied onto the string at the proper point where the nock would normally be placed. The end of the arrow, rather than being slit for a nock, would be sharpened like an arrowhead, then the rear end of the arrow would be slipped into this ring and drawn and released as usual. Then the enemy could collect all the arrows it wanted, but they would be useless to them in shooting back. A piece of battle advice was to have several rings tied onto the bowstring in case one broke.
