Additionally, a game known variously by names such as "Archery Golf" or "Gol-Archery" adopts some of the rules of golf to play a game that uses traditional or modern archery tools. Players shoot arrows or similar projectiles into a series of holes, goals or targets on a course, with the objective being to do so using the fewest number of shots.
