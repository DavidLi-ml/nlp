The Office and Board used the broad arrow to signify at first objects purchased from the monarch's money and later to indicate government property since at least the 17th century. The introduction of this symbol is attributed to Sir Philip Sidney, Joint Master of the Ordnance in 1585/6, since the pheon appears in the arms of the Sidney family.
