Alternatively—just as in the "turkey" (which is also from America), or the "guineafowl" (which are not limited to Guinea)—"Muscovy" might be simply a generic term for a hard-to-reach and exotic place, in reference to the singular appearance of these birds. This is evidenced by other names suggesting the species came from lands where it is not actually native, but from where much "outlandish" produce was imported at that time (see below).
