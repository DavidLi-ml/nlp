Feral Muscovy ducks can breed near urban and suburban lakes and on farms, nesting in tree cavities or on the ground, under shrubs in yards, on apartment balconies, or under roof overhangs. Some feral populations, such as that in Florida, have a reputation of becoming nuisance pests on occasion. At night they often sleep at water, if there is a water source available, to flee quickly from predators if awoken. A small population of Muscovy ducks can also be found in Ely, Cambridgeshire, and in Lincoln, Lincolnshire UK. Muscovy ducks have also been spotted in Walsall Arboretum.
