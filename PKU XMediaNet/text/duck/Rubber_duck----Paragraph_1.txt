The history of the rubber duck is linked to the emergence of rubber manufacturing in the late 19th century. The earliest rubber ducks were made from harder rubber when manufacturers began using Charles Goodyear's invention. As a consequence, these solid rubber ducks were not capable of floating, but instead were intended for use as chew toys.
