The American black duck (Anas rubripes) is a large dabbling duck. The scientific name is derived from Latin. Anas means "duck", and rubripes comes from ruber "red" and pes, "foot". American black ducks are similar to mallards in size, and resemble the female mallard in coloration, although the black duck's plumage is darker. It is native to eastern North America and has shown reduction in numbers and increasing hybridization with the more common mallard as that species has spread with man-made habitat changes.
