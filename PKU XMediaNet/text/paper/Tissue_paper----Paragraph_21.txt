The paper industry in general has a long history of accusations for being responsible for global deforestation through legal and illegal logging. The WWF has urged Asia Pulp & Paper (APP), "one of the world's most notorious deforesters" especially in Sumatran rain forests, to become an environmentally responsible company; in 2012, the WWF launched a campaign to remove a brand of toilet paper known to be made from APP fiber from grocery store shelves  According to the Worldwatch Institute, the world per capita consumption of toilet paper was 3.8 kilograms in 2005. The WWF estimates that "every day, about 270,000 trees are flushed down the drain or end up as garbage all over the world", a rate of which about 10% are attributable to toilet paper alone.
