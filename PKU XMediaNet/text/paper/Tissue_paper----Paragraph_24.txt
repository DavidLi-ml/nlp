There has been a great deal of interest, in particular, in the use of recovered fibres to manufacture new tissue paper products.

A Life Cycle Assessment study indicated that neither fibre type can be considered environmentally preferable. In this study both new fibre and recovered fibre offer environmental benefits and shortcomings.
