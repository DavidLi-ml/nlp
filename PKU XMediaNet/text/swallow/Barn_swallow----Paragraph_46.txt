The barn swallow symbolizes the coming of spring and thus love in the Pervigilium Veneris, a late Latin poem. In "The Waste Land", T. S. Eliot quoted the line "Quando fiam uti chelidon [ut tacere desinam]?" ("When will I be like the swallow, so that I can stop being silent?") This refers to a version of the myth of Philomela in which she turns into a nightingale and her sister Procne into a swallow; in less familiar versions, the two species are reversed. On the other hand, an image of the assembly of swallows for their southward migration concludes John Keats's ode "To Autumn".
