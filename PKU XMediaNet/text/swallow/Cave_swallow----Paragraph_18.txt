Cave swallows are most often heard singing from March to August in Texas and New Mexico, corresponding more or less to their breeding season. In general, birds are vocal throughout the day when their nesting colony is active, however, they are usually loud and vocal at their nest site, becoming quieter as they move away from their nest.
