Cave swallows are altricial when they hatch; they are blind and incapable of sustaining their own body heat. They remain in the nest until they are capable of flying, which is approximately 20 to 22 days after hatching. Both parents will feed the nestlings small insects throughout the day and will defend the nest if threatened by swooping and loudly calling at the threat.
