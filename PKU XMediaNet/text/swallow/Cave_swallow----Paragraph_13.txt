The cave swallow's song typically lasts 3–4 seconds and is described as a "series of squeaks that gradually blend into a ‘complex melodic warble’ and end in a series of double-toned notes in which a ‘gua’ sound and a very low ‘nock’ sound are given simultaneously." It is also noted that sometimes the song ends in with a "sharp eep note."
