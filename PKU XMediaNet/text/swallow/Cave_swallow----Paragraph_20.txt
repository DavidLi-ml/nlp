A benefit to nesting in colonies could be the ability to share and procure information about food sources from neighbouring birds while raising chicks. While research has not been conducted on cave swallows themselves, some studies have been done on the closely related cliff and bank swallows. Cliff swallow nesting colonies have been suggested to serve as, "information centres", where swallows can gather and glean information from one another regarding how well they are foraging. Cliff swallows have been observed to follow, or be followed by, other birds within the nesting colony to food sources; birds that were unsuccessful foraging will return to the colony to find a fellow roost-mate that has been successful, whom they will follow to a food source. Bank swallows, however, do not appear to use small nesting colonies (26-52 nesting pairs is considered a small colony) as, "information centres", but it should be noted that the cliff swallow colonies previously mentioned were large colonies in which there are more potentially successful foragers for other birds to follow.
