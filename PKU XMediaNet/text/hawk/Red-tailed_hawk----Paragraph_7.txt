Immature birds can be readily identified at close range by their yellowish irises. As the bird attains full maturity over the course of 3â€“4 years, the iris slowly darkens into a reddish-brown hue. In both the light and dark morphs, the tail of the immature red-tailed hawk is patterned with numerous darker bars.
