The northern goshawk, like all accipiters, exhibits sexual dimorphism, where females are significantly larger than males. Males, being the smaller sex by around 10 – 25%, are 46–57 cm (18–22 in) long and have a 89–105 cm (35–41 in) wingspan. The female is much larger, 58–69 cm (23–27 in) long with a 108–127 cm (43–50 in) wingspan. Males average around 780 g (1.72 lb), with a range of 500 to 1,200 g (1.1 to 2.6 lb). The female can be more than twice as heavy, averaging 1,220 g (2.69 lb) with a range of 820 to 2,200 g (1.81 to 4.85 lb). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 28.6–39 cm (11.3–15.4 in), the tail is 20–28 cm (7.9–11.0 in), the culmen is 2–2.6 cm (0.79–1.02 in) and the tarsus is 6.8–9 cm (2.7–3.5 in). In Eurasia, the species follows Bergmann's rule: specimens from the northern races generally are larger-bodied than goshawks near the southern reaches of the species range. Going on wing chord length, A. g. apache, found in Mexico to Arizona and New Mexico, is the largest subspecies at an average of 36.8 cm (14.5 in) and is larger than more northern subspecies in that continent, thus running contrary to Bergmann's rule. A. g. fujiyamae of Japan is the smallest race, at 30.9 cm (12.2 in) in wing chord length. In Europe, goshawks from Finland or of Finnish ancestry are prized as bigger than other goshawks.
