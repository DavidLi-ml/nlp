Drum and Bass (/ˈdrʌm ənd ˈbeɪs/) (also written as "Drum 'n' Bass" and commonly abbreviated as "D&B", "DnB", or "D'n'B") is a genre of electronic music which emerged from rave and oldschool jungle scenes in England during the early 1990s. The style is often characterized by fast breakbeats (typically between 150–180 beats per minute) with heavy bass and sub-bass lines, sampled sources, and synthesizers.
