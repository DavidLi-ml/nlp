The first modern acoustic bass guitar was developed in the mid-1950s by Kay of Chicago but the design did not show up again in a production instrument until the early 1960s when Ernie Ball of San Luis Obispo, California, began producing a model. Ball's aim was to provide bass guitarists with a more acoustic-sounding instrument that would match better with the sound of acoustic guitars. Ball stated that "...if there were electric bass guitars to go with electric guitars then you ought to have acoustic basses to go with acoustic guitars." Ball notes that "...the closest thing to an acoustic bass was the Mexican guitarron...in mariachi bands, so I bought one down in Tijuana and tinkered with it."
