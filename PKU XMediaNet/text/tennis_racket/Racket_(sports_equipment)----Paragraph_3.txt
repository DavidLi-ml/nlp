Racket is the standard spelling of the word. Racquet is an alternative spelling used more commonly in certain sports (squash, racquetball, badminton) and less commonly in others (tennis). Racket is the preferred spelling in tennis. While some writers, especially those outside North America, prefer the French-influenced racquet, racket is the predominant spelling by a large margin. Similarly, while some believe that racket came about as a misspelling of racquet, racket is in fact the older spelling: it has been in use since the 16th century, with racquet only showing up later in the 19th century as a variant of racket.
