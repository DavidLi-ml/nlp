Modern tennis rackets vary in length, weight, and head size. 21 to 26 inches (53 to 66 cm) is normally a junior's length, while 27 and 27.5 inches (69 and 70 cm) are for stronger and taller adult players. Some are also available at lengths of 28 to 29 inches (71 to 74 cm). Weights of a racket also vary between 8 ounces (230 g) unstrung and 12.5 ounces (350 g) strung. Rackets originally flared outward at the bottom of the handle to prevent slipping. The rounded bottom was called a bark bottom after its inventor Matthew Barker. But by 1947, this style became superfluous. Head size also plays a role in a racket's qualities. A larger head size generally means more power and a larger "sweet spot" that is more forgiving on off-center hits. A smaller head size offers more precise control. Current racket head sizes vary between 85–137 square inches (550–880 cm2), with most players adopting one from 95–105 square inches (610–680 cm2). Rackets that are mid way in weight, size and player ability, are often called "tweener rackets."
