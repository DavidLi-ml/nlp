Throughout most of tennis' history, rackets were made of laminated wood, with heads of around 65 square inches (420 cm2). In the late 1960s, Wilson produced the T2000 steel racket with wire wound around the frame to make string loops. It was popularized by the top American player Jimmy Connors. In 1968 Spalding launched an aluminum racket, called The Smasher. Aluminium, though lighter and more flexible than steel, was less accurate than wood. Because of this, most of the top players still preferred to use wooden frames, and a decade later they were still in use.
