Built-in icemakers are engineered to fit under a kitchen or bar counter, but they can be used as freestanding units. They produce crescent-shaped ice like the ice from a freezer icemaker. The ice is cloudy and opaque instead of clear, because the water is frozen faster than in clear cube icemakers. In the process, tiny air bubbles get trapped, causing the cloudy appearance of the ice.
