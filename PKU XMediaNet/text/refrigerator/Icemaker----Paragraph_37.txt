A tube ice generator is an ice generator in which the water is frozen in tubes that are extended vertically within a surrounding casingâ€”the freezing chamber. At the bottom of the freezing chamber there is a distributor plate having apertures surrounding the tubes and attached to the separate chamber into which a warm gas is passed to heat the tubes and cause the ice rods to slide down.
