The ammonia (gas) and hydrogen (gas) solution flows through a pipe from the evaporator into the absorber. In the absorber, the solution of gas flows into a solution of ammonia (liquid) and water (liquid). The ammonia dissolves in the water and the hydrogen collects at the top of the absorber, while the ammonia (liquid) and water (liquid) solution remains at the bottom. The hydrogen is now separate, but the ammonia is now mixed with water.
