The effectiveness of evaporative cooling varies with the temperature, humidity and airflow. Given a constant flow of cool dry air the inner pot can achieve temperatures as low as 40 °F (4.4 °C), which is the temperature below which mesophilic ("middle temperature") bacteria such as food spoilage bacteria have significantly slowed growth.
