Screw compressors can yield the largest refrigerating effect among positive displacement compressors, with their refrigerating capacity normally ranging from 50 RT to 400 RT. Screw compressors also can be divided to single-screw type and dual-screw type. Dual-screw type is more often seen in use because it is very efficient.
