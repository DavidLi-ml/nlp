A single-pressure absorption refrigerator takes advantage of the fact that a substance's boiling point depends upon the partial pressure of the vapor above the liquid and goes up with higher partial pressure. While having the same total pressure throughout the system, the refrigerator maintains a low partial pressure of the refrigerant (therefore low boiling point) in the part of the system that draws heat out of the low-temperature interior of the refrigerator, but maintains the refrigerant at high partial pressure (therefore high boiling point) in the part of the system that expels heat to the high-temperature air outside the refrigerator.
