Freezer units are used in households and in industry and commerce. Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. Most households use the freezer-on-top-and-refrigerator-on-bottom style, which has been the basic style since the 1940s. A vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators, refrigeratorâ€“freezers and freezers. Newer refrigerators may include automatic defrosting, chilled water and ice from a dispenser in the door.
