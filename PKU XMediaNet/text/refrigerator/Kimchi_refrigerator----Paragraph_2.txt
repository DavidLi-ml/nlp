The prototype of kimchi refrigerators was created by Billtec in 1992. In December 1995, WiniaMando launched its first commercial brand name of 'DIMCHAE' (Hangul: 딤채) into the mass market, after three years of comprehensive work on developing software best suited kimchi fermentation and storage. Now, more than a dozen home appliance manufacturers, such as Samsung and LG, are vigorously involved in commercial production of kimchi refrigerators.
