In comparison, a compressor refrigerator uses an electrically powered compressor to increase the pressure on the gaseous refrigerant, the resulting hot high pressure gas is condensed to a liquid form by cooling in a heat exchanger with the external environment (usually air in the room). The condensed refrigerant now at a temperature near to that of the external environment, then passes through an orifice or a throttle valve into the evaporator section. The orifice or throttle valve creates a pressure drop between the high pressure condenser section and the low pressure evaporator section. The lower pressure in the evaporator section allows the liquid refrigerant to evaporate more easily and in the process of evaporating, absorb heat from the refrigerator food compartment. The vaporized refrigerant then goes back into the compressor to repeat the cycle.
