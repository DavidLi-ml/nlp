The evaporator of the flake ice machine is a vertically placed drum-shape stainless steel container, equipped with the rotating blade which spins and scratches the ice off the inner wall of the drum. When operating, the principal shaft and blade spins anti-clockwise pushed by the reducer. Water is sprayed down from the sprinkler; ice is formed from the water brain on the inner wall. The water tray at the bottom catches the cold water while deflecting Ice and re-circulates it back into the sump. The sump will typically use a float valve to fill as needed during production. Flake machines have a tendency to form an ice ring inside the bottom of the drum. Electric heaters are in wells at the very bottom to prevent this accumulation of ice where the crusher does not reach. Some machines use scrapers to assist this. This system utilizes a low temperature condensing unit; like all ice machines. Most manufactures also utilize an E.P.R.V. (Evaporator pressure regulating valve.)
