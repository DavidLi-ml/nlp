Although the top-loading types were introduced first, this design took up much space and heavy plastic kimchi containers had to be lifted to get to the bottom part. The door-drawer types (the "stand-type" in Korea) are gaining popularity in because of their space-saving ergonomic design. A single door with a wine-bar type design at the top can be opened in full or partially at the wine-bar section to save energy. The top portion can be used as a freezer.
