The next step separates the ammonia and water. The ammonia/water solution flows to the generator, where heat is applied to evaporate the ammonia, leaving most of the water, with its higher boiling point, behind. Some water vapor and bubbles remain mixed with the ammonia; this water is removed in the final separation step, by passing it through the separator, an uphill series of twisted pipes with minor obstacles to pop the bubbles, allowing the water vapor to condense and drain back to the generator.
