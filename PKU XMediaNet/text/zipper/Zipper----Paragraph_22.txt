Two way open-ended zippers Instead of having an insertion pin and pin box at the bottom, a two way open-ended zipper has a puller on each end of the zipper tape. The user can slide up the bottom puller when a zipped garment is being worn, so that the bottom part of the zipper will be opened for situation where more legs movement is needed, without adding unnecessary tension on the pin and box of a one-way open-ended zipper when it is zipped, which could cause accidental damage on the zipper. It is most commonly used on long coats.
