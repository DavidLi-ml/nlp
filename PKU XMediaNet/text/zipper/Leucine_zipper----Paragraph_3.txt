Leucine zipper is created by the dimerization of two specific alpha helix monomers bound to DNA. The bZIP interacts with the DNA via its N-terminal, where the lysines and arginines are located; these basic residues interact in the major groove of the DNA, forming sequence-specific interactions. The leucine zipper is located in the C-terminal region of the bZIP and it forms an amphipathic alpha helix. When that alpha helix dimerizes, the zipper is formed. The hydrophobic side of the helix forms a dimer with itself or another similar helix, burying the non-polar amino acids away from the solvent. The hydrophilic side of the helix interacts with the water in the solvent.
