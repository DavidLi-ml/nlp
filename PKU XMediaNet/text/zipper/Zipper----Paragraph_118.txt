The zipper may be used to secure an article of clothing, a tent or other fabric enclosure, luggage, or other soft container. Another popular method of securing clothing presses a thin and sharpened wire through the fabric using a brooch or safety pin. A buckle is used in place of a zipper at times. Buttons are another way to secure clothing, and require dexterous fingers to properly use. Snap fasteners (also named poppers and press studs) and the hook and loop fastener are a few less common zipper alternatives.
