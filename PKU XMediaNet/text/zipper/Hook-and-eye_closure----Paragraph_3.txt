The first reference to the modern term appears in Aubrey's Brief Lives in 1697, which describes a doublet and breeches being attached with "hook and eies". Hooks and eyes were made by hand from wire, until the city of Redditch, England, already famous for needle manufacture, was the first to machine-manufacture them. In 1643 a woman in the American colony of Maryland is recorded to have paid Â£10 worth of tobacco for hooks and eyes.
