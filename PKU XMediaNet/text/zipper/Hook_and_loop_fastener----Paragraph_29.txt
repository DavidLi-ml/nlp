In the fictional universe of Star Trek, Velcro was invented by the Vulcans. In the Star Trek: Enterprise episode "Carbon Creek", a sample touch fastener is taken from a crashed Vulcan starship by T'Mir and given to a patent clerk to raise money for a teenage boy's college career. Also, one of the Vulcan crew members in that episode is named Mestral.
