In 2012, the US Navy announced that women would begin serving on US attack submarines in 2013. In 2013, US Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said that the first women to join Virginia-class attack subs had been chosen. They were newly commissioned female officers scheduled to report to their subs in fiscal year 2015. On 15 October 2013, the US Navy announced that two submarines, USS Virginia and USS Minnesota, would have female crew-members by January 2015. By late 2011 several women were assigned to USS Wyoming.
