In the US Navy, SSBNs are sometimes called Fleet Ballistic Missile submarines, or FBMs. In US naval slang, ballistic missile submarines are called boomers. In Britain, they are known as bombers. In both cases, SSBN submarines operate on a two-crew concept, with two complete crews - including two captains - called Gold and Blue in the United States, Starboard and Port in the United Kingdom.
