Both the US and British navies operate nuclear-powered submarines that deploy for periods of six months or longer. Other navies that permit women to serve on submarines operate conventionally powered submarines, which deploy for much shorter periodsâ€”usually only for a few months. Prior to the change by the US, no nation using nuclear submarines permitted women to serve on board.
