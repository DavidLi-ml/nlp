The distinctive sound of a violin is the result of interactions between its many parts. Drawing a bow across the strings causes the strings to vibrate. This vibration is transmitted through the bridge and sound post to the body of the violin (mainly the top and back), which allows the sound to effectively radiate into the surrounding air. The tension and type of strings, placement and tension of the sound post, quality of the bow, and the construction of the body, all contribute to the loudness and tonal quality of the sound.
