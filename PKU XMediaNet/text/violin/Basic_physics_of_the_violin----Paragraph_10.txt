In bowing, the three most prominent factors under the player's immediate control are bow speed, downward force, and location of the sounding point where hair crosses string. The desired sounding point will generally move closer to the bridge as the string is stopped to a shorter sounding length. The player may also vary the amount of hair in contact with the string by tilting the bow stick more or less away from the bridge. Violinists are trained to keep the bow perpendicular to the string in most cases, as other angles may adversely affect the sound.
