Today electric violins are even being used to reinvigorate music education. NBC, for example, recently featured a "music camp that combines rock and orchestra" by Mark Wood, who was chosen as the "person of the day" and featured on the Today show for bringing fresh interest to music education with rock performances all on electric violins where proceeds are donated back to school music programs. The Today show stated "The perfect blend of classical instruments and rock and roll is giving kids across the country a whole new appreciation for music."
