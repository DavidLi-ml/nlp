End-blown flutes are widespread in folk music and art music. In the Middle East and Mediterranean the ney is frequently used, constructed from reed. Depictions of early versions of the ney can be found in wall paintings in ancient Egyptian tombs, indicating that it is one of the oldest musical instruments in continuous use. Further, several ancient Persian artworks also depict the use of Ney in Persian traditional music.
