One is a "contrabass flute in G," pitched a fourth below the bass flute and an octave lower than the alto flute; thus, this is technically, a contra-alto flute. The other instrument is a "sub contrabass flute in G" pitched one octave below the contra-alto flute, or two octaves below the alto flute in G. Kotato & Fukushima also produce a "sub contrabass flute in C", a large, deep instrument pitched a full octave below the contrabass flute in C.
