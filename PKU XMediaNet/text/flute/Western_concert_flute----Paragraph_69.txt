Jethro Tull is probably the best-known rock group to make regular use of the flute, played by their frontman, Ian Anderson. An alto flute is briefly heard in The Beatles' song "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away", played by John Scott. The Beatles would later feature a flute more prominently in their single "Penny Lane".
