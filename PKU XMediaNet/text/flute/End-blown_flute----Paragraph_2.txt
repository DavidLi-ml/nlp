In Turkey the ney and kaval are both end-blown, although one type of Turkish kaval (dilli kaval) has a fipple. The Turkish ney plays a prominent role in classical Turkish music and Mevlevi (Sufi) music. The Arab nay and the Persian ney are similar to the Turkish ney. China has the xiao, Japan has the shakuhachi and Korea has the danso and tongso. People of the Andes play the quena, the Hopi and their predecessors the Anasazi of the American southwest have and had a flute similar to the ney. The washint is an East African flute. Panpipes are rim-blown in the same fashion with their lower ends stopped, bound together in a row or "raft".
