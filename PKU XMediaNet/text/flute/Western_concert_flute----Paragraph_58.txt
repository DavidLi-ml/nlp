All of Boehmâ€™s original models had offset G keys, which are mechanically simpler, and permit a more relaxed hand position, especially for younger players or those with small hands. Some players prefer the hand position of the in-line G. For many years, there was a misperception that inline G was for "professional" flutes while offset G was for "student" models, but this stereotype is largely debunked.
