Although the PVC instrument was designed to be an ensemble instrument it was soon discovered by various solo artists who saw the merits of the instrument for their musical purposes. The bore is wider than what one usually finds in a metal double contrabass flute. The instrument is comparatively light, weighing only 7 kg (compared to 15 kg for the brass version), and can be produced relatively quickly and inexpensively. In addition, the PVC appears to produce a broad tone.
