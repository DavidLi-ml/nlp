Trill Keys – two small, teardrop shaped keys between the right-hand keys on the body; the first enables an easy C-D trill, and the second enables C-D♯. A-B♭ lever or "trill" key is located in line directly above the right first-finger key. An optional C♯ trill key which facilitates the trill from B to C♯ is sometimes found on intermediate- and professional-quality flutes. The two trill keys are also used in playing the high B♭ and B.
