Furthermore, the contrabass flute is being utilized more in the flute choir with most newer pieces including a part for the instrument. Though for many pieces, the part is either a duplicate or simplification of the bass flute part, some of the newest repertoire includes an independent contrabass flute part. Composers of such pieces include Toby Caplan-Stonefield, Lawrence Ink, Phyllis Avidan Louke, and Judy Nishimura, among others.
