The three standard trill keys permit rapid alternation between two notes with disparate standard fingerings: lowest, middle, and highest trill keys ease C-D♯, C-D, and B♭-A, respectively. Some higher notes (third octave B and B♭ and most fourth octave notes) also require use of the two lower trill keys. A fourth so-called C♯ trill key is an increasingly popular option available on many flutes. It is named after one of its uses (to ease the B to C♯ trill) but it also allows some trills and tremolos that are otherwise very difficult, such as high G to high A. Another way of trilling G6-A6 is a dedicated high G-A trill key.
