As the name suggests, the five-key flute most commonly has five keys, similar to the simple system flute that was the standard orchestral instrument before Boehm keying and bore became the standard. It uses the six-hole fingering system of the fife for its natural scale, with the metal keys adding the ability to play the full chromatic scale and therefore making it possible to play in any key.
