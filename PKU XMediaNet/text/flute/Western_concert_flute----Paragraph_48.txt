Professionals tend to play more expensive flutes made from more expensive materials. However, the idea that different materials can significantly affect sound quality is under some contention, and some argue that different metals make less difference in sound quality than different flautists playing the same flute. Even Verne Q. Powell, a flute maker, admitted (In Needed: A Gold Flute or a Gold Lip?) that As far as tone is concerned, I contend that 90 percent of it is the man behind the flute.
