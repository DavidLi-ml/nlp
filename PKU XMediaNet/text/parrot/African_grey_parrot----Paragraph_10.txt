African greys are also highly intelligent, having been shown to perform at the cognitive level of a 4â€“ to 6-year-old child in some tasks. New experiments have shown that African greys can learn number sequences and can associate human voices with those humans' faces. Most notably, Dr Irene Pepperberg's work with Alex the parrot showed his ability to learn over 100 words, differentiating between objects, colors, materials, and shapes.
