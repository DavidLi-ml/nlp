Parrots do not have vocal cords, so sound is accomplished by expelling air across the mouth of the bifurcated trachea, in the organ called the syrinx. Different sounds are produced by changing the depth and shape of the trachea. African grey parrots of all subspecies are known for their superior ability to imitate sounds and human speech. This ability has made them prized as pets from ancient times to the present. In the Masnavi, written by Rumi of Persia in 1250, the author describes an ancient method for training parrots to speak.
