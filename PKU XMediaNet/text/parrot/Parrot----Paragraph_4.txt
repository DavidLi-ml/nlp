Psittaciform diversity in South America and Australasia suggests that the order may have evolved in Gondwanaland, centred in Australasia. The scarcity of parrots in the fossil record, however, presents difficulties in confirming the hypothesis. Molecular studies suggest that parrots evolved approximately 59 Mya (range 66–51 Mya) in Gondwanaland. The three major clades of Neotropical parrots originated about 50 Ma (range 57–41 Ma).
