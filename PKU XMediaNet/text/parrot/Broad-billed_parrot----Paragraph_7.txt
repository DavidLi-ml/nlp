The taxonomic affinities of the broad-billed parrot are undetermined. Considering its large jaws and other osteological features, Edward Newton and Hans Gadow thought it to be closely related to the Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus), but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus, since a crest was only known from the latter. Graham S. Cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives.
