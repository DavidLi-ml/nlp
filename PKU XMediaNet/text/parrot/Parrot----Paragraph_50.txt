Sayings about parrots colour the modern English language. The verb "parrot" in the dictionary means "to repeat by rote". Also clich√©s such as the British expression "sick as a parrot" are given; although this refers to extreme disappointment rather than illness, it may originate from the disease of psittacosis, which can be passed to humans. The first occurrence of a related expression is in Aphra Behn's 1681 play The False Count. Fans of Jimmy Buffett are known as parrotheads, named after the colorful birds. Parrots feature in many media. Magazines are devoted to parrots as pets, and to the conservation of parrots. Fictional films include Home Alone 3 and Rio, and documentaries include The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill.
