Alex died on September 6, 2007, at the age of 31. Alex's death came as a surprise; the average life span for African grey parrots is sixty years. He appeared healthy the day prior, but was found dead in the morning. According to a press release issued by the Alex Foundation, "Alex was found to be in good health at his most recent annual physical about two weeks [before his death]. According to the veterinarian who conducted the necropsy, there was no obvious cause of death." According to Pepperberg, Alex's loss will not stop the research, but will be a setback. The lab has two other birds, but they are not comparable to Alex.
