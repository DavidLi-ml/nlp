The yellow-headed amazon, yellow-naped amazon, orange-winged amazon, and blue-fronted amazon are some of the amazon parrot species which are commonly kept as pets. Amazon parrots, together with macaws and the African grey parrot, are all known for their exceptional vocal abilities, playfulness, and dexterity with their feet. Well-trained parrots can be loyal companions, and they can live for 50 years or sometimes more in captivity. However, some amazons—even well-trained ones—can become aggressive, possibly during mating season. To maintain health and happiness, pet parrots require much more training than domesticated animals such as dogs or even cats. They require understanding, manipulative toys, and rewards for good pet-like behavior, or they can develop quite aggressive behaviors. They have a strong, innate need to chew, thus require safe, destructible toys.
