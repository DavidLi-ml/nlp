Humans and parrots have a complicated relationship. Economically, they can be beneficial to communities as sources of income from the pet trade and are highly marketable tourism draws and symbols, but some species are also economically important pests, particularly some cockatoo species in Australia. Some parrots have also benefited from human changes to the environment in some instances, and have expanded their ranges alongside agricultural activity, but many species have declined, as well.
