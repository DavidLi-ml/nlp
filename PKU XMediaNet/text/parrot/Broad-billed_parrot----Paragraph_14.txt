In 2015, a translation of the 1660s report of Johannes Pretorius about his stay on Mauritius was published, wherein he described the bird as "very beautifully coloured". Hume accordingly reinterpreted Hoffman's account, and suggested the bird may have been brightly coloured with a red body, blue head, and red beak; the bird was illustrated as such in the paper by Ria Winters. Possible iridescent or glossy feathers that changed appearance according to angle of light may also have given the impression that it had even more colours. It has also been suggested that in addition to size dimorphism, the sexes may have had different colours, which would explain some of the discrepancies in old descriptions.
