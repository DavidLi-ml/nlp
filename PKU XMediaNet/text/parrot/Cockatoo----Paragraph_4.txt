The word cockatoo dates from the 17th century and is a derivation from the Indonesian name for these birds, "kakak tua" (meaning "older sibling") or from the call of the white cockatoo itself. Seventeenth-century variants include cacato, cockatoon and crockadore, and cokato, cocatore and cocatoo were used in the eighteenth century. The derivation has also been used for the family and generic names Cacatuidae and Cacatua respectively.
