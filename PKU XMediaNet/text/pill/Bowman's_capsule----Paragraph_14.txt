Bowman's capsule is named after Sir William Bowman (1816-1892), a British surgeon and anatomist.  However, thorough microscopical anatomy of kidney including the nephronic capsule was described by the Ukrainian surgeon and anatomist from the Russian Empire, Prof. Alexander Shumliansky (1748-1795), in his 1788 doctoral thesis "De structura renum: Tractatus physiologico-anatomicus" ("About Kidney Structure: an Physiological-Anatomical Treatise," in Latin); thus, much prior to Bowman.
