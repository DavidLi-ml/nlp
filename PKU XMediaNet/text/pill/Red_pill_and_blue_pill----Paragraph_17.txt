In cybersecurity, a red pill (deonomized from Rutkowska's Red Pill) is any means of detecting hooking or virtualization. It is frequently used for testing if the trusted environment is required: BYOD, anti-cheat, antirootkit software, malware and DRM, etc... To have a red pill you usually need an uncompromised trusted real-time clock to be able to measure the time it takes to make some hooked action. If the clock is compromised the hypervisor can hide its presence by slowing the clock down in controlled way.
