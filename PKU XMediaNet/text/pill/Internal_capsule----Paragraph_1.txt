The corticospinal tract constitutes a large part of the internal capsule, carrying motor information from the primary motor cortex to the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord. Above the basal nuclei the corticospinal tract is a part of the corona radiata, below the basal nuclei the tract is called crus cerebri (a part of the cerebral peduncle) and below the pons it is referred to as the corticospinal tract.
