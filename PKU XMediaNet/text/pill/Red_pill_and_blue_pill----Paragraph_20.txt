The term "red pill" is frequently used by people in the men's rights movement as a metaphor for the specific moment when they come to the belief that certain gender roles they are expected to conform to (e.g. marriage, monogamy) are intended to benefit women, not themselves. "The Red Pill" is also the name of a related manosphere and seduction community subforum on Reddit.
