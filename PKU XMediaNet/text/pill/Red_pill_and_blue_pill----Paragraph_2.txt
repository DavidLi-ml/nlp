The Matrix makes references to historical myths and philosophy, including gnosticism, existentialism, and nihilism. The film's premise resembles Plato's Allegory of the cave, Ren√© Descartes's skepticism and evil demon, Kant's reflections on the Phenomenon versus the Ding an sich, Zhuangzi's "Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly", the concept of a simulated reality and the brain in a vat thought experiment.
