However, when the Ministry of Health and Welfare approved Viagra's use in Japan after only six months of the application's submission, while still claiming that the Pill required more data before approval, women's groups cried foul. The Pill was subsequently approved for use in June 1999. However, the Pill has not become popular in Japan. According to estimates, only 1.3 percent of 28 million Japanese females of childbearing age use the Pill, compared with 15.6 percent in the United States. The Pill prescription guidelines the government has endorsed require Pill users to visit a doctor every three months for pelvic examinations and undergo tests for sexually transmitted diseases and uterine cancer. In the United States and Europe, in contrast, an annual or bi-annual clinic visit is standard for Pill users. However, beginning as far back as 2007, many Japanese OBGYNs have required only a yearly visit for pill users, with tri-annual visits only recommended for those who are older or at increased risk of side effects. As of 2004, condoms accounted for 80% of birth control use in Japan, and this may explain Japan's comparatively low rates of AIDS.
