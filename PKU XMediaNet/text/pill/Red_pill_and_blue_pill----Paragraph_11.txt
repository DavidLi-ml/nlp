The 1990 movie Total Recall features a red pill that is offered to Arnold Schwarzenegger's character, Douglas Quaid. He is told "it's a symbolâ€”of your desire to return to reality." No blue pill is present in the film, and the story centers on the very uncertainty of whether Quaid is dreaming or in the real world. However, the pill is offered to him with the claim that he is dreaming, and that the pill will return him to reality, with the words "inside your dream, you'll fall asleep."
