The 2013 movie The Secret Life of Walter Mitty shows Ben Stiller's character who needs to hire a car by choosing between two Daewoo Matiz, a blue or a red one. When Walter lands at Nuuk in Greenland, he asks the man in the airport booth: "Do you have any cars available?" "Yeah, we have a blue one and a red one", the man replies. "I'll take the red one", says Walter.
