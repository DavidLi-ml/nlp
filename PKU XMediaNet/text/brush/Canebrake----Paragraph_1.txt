Canebrakes were formerly widespread in the Southern United States but have been widely replaced by agriculture. Concomitant with this destruction have been challenges to the survival of the Florida panther (Puma concolor subsp. coryi) and Bachman's warbler (Vermivora bachmanii), the latter of which is critically endangered and may in fact be extinct. Other species considered canebreak specialists include several butterfly species, and Swainson's warbler (Limnothlypis swainsonii). Swainson's warbler has recently been found to use pine plantations (widespread across the Southeastern United States) of a particular age, as they may provide the structural features and prey base that the species seeks.
