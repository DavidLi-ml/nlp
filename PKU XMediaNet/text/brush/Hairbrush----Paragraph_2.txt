A brush is typically used on long hair while a comb is normally used on shorter hair; however, both may be used for either. A flat brush is normally used for detangling hair, for example after sleep or showering. A round brush can be used for styling and curling hair, especially by a professional stylist, often with a blowdryer. A paddle brush is used to straighten hair, flatten long hair, and tame fly-aways. A hairbrush can be used to remove loose hairs, and increase circulation to the scalp. For babies, many bristle materials are not suitable due to the hardness; some synthetic materials and horsehair/goat hair bristles are appropriate.
