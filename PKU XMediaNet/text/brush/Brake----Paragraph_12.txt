Ceramic brakes, also called "carbon ceramic", are high-end type of frictional brakes with brake pads and rotors made from porcelain compound blends, that feature better stopping capability and greater resistance to overheat. Due to their high production cost, ceramic brakes aren't widely used as a factory equipment, and their availability on the automotive aftermarket is low compared to traditional metallic brakes. However, being a performance-oriented equipment, ceramic brakes are popular among racers.
