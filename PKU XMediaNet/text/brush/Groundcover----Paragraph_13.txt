Groundcover is also a commonly used alternative to grass. Using grass in lawns requires an extensive amount of water and potentially dangerous pesticides that damage the soil and can prove harmful to humans. However, groundcover requires less amounts of water, sunlight, shade and additional nutrients due to its durable nature. Additionally, mixing several different types of groundcover together lowers the amount of pesticides in the soil and increases pest resistance. There are many different types of groundcover suited to providing natural carpeting, such as perennials, or fragrances, such as clover.
