The earliest U.S. patent for a modern hairbrush was by Hugh Rock in 1854. A brush with elastic wire teeth along with natural bristles, was patented by Samuel Firey in 1870 as U.S. Patent 106,680. In 1898, Lyda A. Newman invented an "Improved Hairbrush," which allowed for easily cleaning and had bristles separated wide enough to allow for easy combing. She was awarded U.S. Patent 614,335.
