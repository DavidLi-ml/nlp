Groundcover is a popular solution for difficult gardening issues because itâ€™s low maintenance, aesthetically pleasing and fast growing, which minimizes the spread of weeds. For this reason, ground cover is also a popular choice for roof gardens. Roofs take on the brunt of incoming weather, meaning any plants on a roof must be resistant to long-term exposure to sun, overwatering from rain and harsh winds. Groundcover plants are able to sustain themselves in such conditions while also providing lush vegetation to what would otherwise be unused space.
