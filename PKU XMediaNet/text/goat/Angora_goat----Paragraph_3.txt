Angora goats were first imported into Australia in 1832 and 1833. They came from M Polonceau's stud in France to the property of the Riley family of Raby, New South Wales. Pure bred Angoras were imported from Turkey in subsequent years up to 1873, to properties in New South Wales, Victoria, and later South Australia. Other states followed and there were importations from South Africa in 1873 and from USA between 1890 and 1910.
