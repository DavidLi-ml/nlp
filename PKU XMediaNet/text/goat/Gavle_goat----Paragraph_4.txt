The display has become notable for being a recurring target for vandalism by arson, and has been destroyed several times since the first goat was erected in 1966.Because the fire station is close to the location of the goat, most of the time the fire can be extinguished before the wooden skeleton is severely damaged. If the goat is burned down before December 13th, the feast day of Saint Lucia, the goat has been rebuilt. The skeleton is then treated and repaired, and the goat reconstructed over it, using straw which the Goat Committee has pre-ordered.From 1988 onward, English bookmakers took bets on the goat's survival. To date four people have been caught or convicted for vandalizing the goat.
