The foundation stock for the Australian Cashmere Goat was taken from northern and western Australia<Pattie&Restall, 1996> from the local bush goat population in the late 1970s. The production varies from herd to herd, with the most productive herds averaging 250 grams at a diameter of 15 Âµm. There is a breed and fleece standard, and active development of the breed continues with the University of Western Australia running a sire referencing scheme.
