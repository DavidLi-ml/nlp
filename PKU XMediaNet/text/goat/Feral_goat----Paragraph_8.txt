Feral goats are common in many areas of the Irish west coast including counties Mayo, Donegal and Kerry. In the town of Killorglin, in County Kerry, Puck Fair takes place each year in which a wild goat is captured and crowned "King" of the fair, in a continuation of ancient Celtic practices. The Bilberry Goats are feral goats living on Bilberry Rock in Waterford City, along with the Irish Goat, which is not actually native to Ireland. In the Wicklow mountains NP feral goats can be seen in the surroundings of Glendalough.
