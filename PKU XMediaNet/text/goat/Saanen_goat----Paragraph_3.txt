The Saanen breed was originally developed in Switzerland, south of Canton Berne in the Saanen Valley. They came to international attention in 1893, when several thousands animals from the valley were distributed across Europe. The first documented Saanen goat was brought to the US in 1904, and over the next 30 years, around 150 goats were moved from Switzerland to the US. More Saanens came to the US from England later in the 20th century. In the 21st century, they are still one of the most popular dairy goats in the US.
