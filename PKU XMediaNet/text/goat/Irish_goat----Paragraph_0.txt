The Irish goat breed from Ireland is used for the production of meat and milk. Although this breed is not native to Ireland, domesticated goats have long been kept for milk, meat, and skin. In many parts of the region, feral populations have become established as a result of escapes or deliberate releases from captivity. Populations have persisted in remote and rugged areas to which the animal is ideally adapted. These goats are nimble-footed on crags and precipitous cliffs. They have a range of colours, but the coat is usually a mixture of grey, black, and brown. Both sexes have horns, larger in the male than in the female.
