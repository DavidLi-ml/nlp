Although extensive research has been done on these goats, there have never been any conclusive results that indicate why they behave the way they do. The idea that they have myotonia congenita has seemed to be accurate, but all research has been deemed inconclusive. Beck et al. (1996) studied the chloride ion channels in the neural pathways that propagated action potential to see if these had any correlation to the goats "fainting" tendencies. Although it has been proven that a lack of chloride can cause spontaneous muscle contraction, it is more likely that the actin and myosin filaments in the goat's muscle are being directly affected by a prenatal acetylcholine deficiency as shown by De Luca et al. (1991). Although it is not impossible that there are other reasons that these goats enter myotonic shock, no hypothesis has yet been confirmed.
