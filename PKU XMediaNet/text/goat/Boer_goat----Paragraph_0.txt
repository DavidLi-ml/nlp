The Boer goat is a breed of goat that was developed in South Africa in the early 1900s for meat production. Their name is derived from the Afrikaans (Dutch) word "boer", meaning farmer. Boer goats are a popular breed for meat and their breeding season starts in August and runs through December. Mixed goats are best for small herds because of the genetics in Boer for meat and the genetics in the other goat.
