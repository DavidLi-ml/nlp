Feral goats have caused serious damage to native vegetation on the Galapagos archipelago. The goats first made an appearance on the island of Pinta in 1959, when fisherman brought three goats with them to the Galapagos. By the 1970s, three goats grew to 40,000 and an intervention was needed. Goats destroyed the native species' habitats, spread invasive plants through their excrement (such as the blackberry bush), and wreaked havoc on the island's delicate ecosystem.
