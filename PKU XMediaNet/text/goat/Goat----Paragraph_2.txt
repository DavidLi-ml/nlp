Female goats are referred to as "does" or "nannies;" intact males are called "bucks" or "billies;" and juveniles of both sexes are called "kids". Castrated males are called "wethers". Goat meat from younger animals is called "kid" or cabrito (Spanish), while meat from older animals is known simply as "goat" or sometimes called chevon (French), or in some areas "mutton" (which more often refers to adult sheep meat).
