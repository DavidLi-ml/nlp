In 1999, the government retaliated with Project Isabela: a three-stage plan put in place in order to eradicate goats on the islands. Stage 1 of the plan was called Ground Hunting. The government offered cash awards to locals who would hunt goats. This stage backfired, however, as the locals began breeding the goats in order to make more money. Stage 2 of Project Isabela was called Aerial Attacks. Professional hunters from New Zealand flew in on helicopters and gunned down thousands of goats at a time from the sky, wiping out nearly the rest of the goats on the islands. Stage 3 was called Judas Goats. Female goats were sterilized and given a hormone treatment to be in heat constantly and released. When the females would attract a male, the male goat was then killed on sight. The goat corpses were left where they were killed to rot and restore important nutrients to the soil.
