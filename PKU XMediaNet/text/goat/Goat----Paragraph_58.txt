As a goat's anatomy and physiology is not too dissimilar from that of human, some countries' militaries use goats to train combat medics.

While modern mannequins used in medical training are quite efficient in simulating the behavior of a human body, trainees feel that "the goat exercise provide[s] a sense of urgency that only real life trauma can provide".
