From 23 May 2011 the Flying Scotsman brand was relaunched for a special daily fast service operated by East Coast departing Edinburgh at 05.40 and reaching London in exactly four hours, calling only at Newcastle. It is operated by an InterCity 225 'Mallard' set. Class 91 locomotive 91101 was turned out in a special "Flying Scotsman" livery for the opening day of the service. East Coast claims that this is part of a policy to bring back named trains to restore "a touch of glamour and romance". However, for the first time in its history, it runs in one direction only: there is no northbound equivalent service. Northbound, the fastest timetabled London-to-Edinburgh service now takes 4 hours 19 minutes.
