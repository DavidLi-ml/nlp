The Flying Scotsman is the only passenger service to run non-stop through York (where the train is forced to slow down to around 25 mph (40 km/h) owing to the sharp curve on which the station in built) and Darlington (which the train passes at high speed, as it completely avoids the station roof by running on the adjacent tracks).
