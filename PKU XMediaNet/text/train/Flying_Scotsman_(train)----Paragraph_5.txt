It was the LNER which, in 1924, officially renamed the 10:00 Special Scotch Express linking Edinburgh and London in both directions as the Flying Scotsman, its unofficial name since the 1870s. To further publicise the train, a recently built Gresley A1 Class locomotive was named after the service, and put on display at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition.
