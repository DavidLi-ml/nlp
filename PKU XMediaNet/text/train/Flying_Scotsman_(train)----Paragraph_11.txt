The Flying Scotsman name has been maintained by the operators of Anglo-Scottish trains on the East Coast Main Line since the privatisation of British Rail; the former Great North Eastern Railway even subtitled itself The Route of the Flying Scotsman. The Flying Scotsman was operated by GNER from 1996 to November 2007, and then by National Express East Coast until November 2009.
