Chain-pulling is the act of pulling a cord that activates the train's emergency brakes to stop a train, whether for a genuine emergency or (often) illegally for someone to get on or off the train on the Indian Railway network. Illegal chain-pulling is a serious problem on Indian railways; where miscreants do so to make unscheduled stops near their destination, which delays trains. Penalties for misuse of this facility include a fine of Rs. 1,000 and/or imprisonment up to one year. In an effort to improve the service, former President of India APJ Abdul Kalam proposed an alternate method wherein a passenger in an emergency communicates with the guard and driver of the train.
