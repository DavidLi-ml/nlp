While widely implemented in long-distance rail service, it has also proven successful in the planning of some rapid transit systems. A large portion of the New York City Subway has a 4-track layout, outer two for local trains, and inner two for express trains (on lines with three tracks, the express track provides one-way service, reversing direction as needed). This has also been implemented on Philadelphia's Broad Street Line, on parts of Chicago's Red Line and Purple Line, and on two small parts of London Underground, namely certain sections of the Metropolitan line and the Piccadilly line. Several variations of express services (e.g. semi-express, limited express) are also a feature in major Japanese railways, and on line 1 of the Seoul Metro.
