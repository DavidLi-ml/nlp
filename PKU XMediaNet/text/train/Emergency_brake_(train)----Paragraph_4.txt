Trains often have a facility in each car to enable passengers to apply the brakes in case of emergency. In many modern trains, the driver is able to prevent brake activation when a passenger operates the emergency alarm  - an audible warning is sounded, and the driver is then able to talk to the person who activated the alarm on the intercom and see them on an internal CCTV. The driver can press an override button and hold the brakes off whilst he chooses a safe place to stop the train. Because of possible serious problems, severe fines and/or imprisonment penalties are in place to stop people from activating the brake without good reason.
