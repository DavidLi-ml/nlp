Studded tires were popular in Japan until mid 1980s, but some cities have enacted by-laws preventing the use of studded tires in an effort to reduce dust pollution caused by studded tires. In 1987, group of lawyers in Nagano Prefecture have brought up the issue to Environmental Dispute Coordination Commission to ban the sales of studded tires in Nagano Prefecture. In 1988, Environmental Dispute Coordination Commission and major tire manufactures in Japan have agreed to stop the manufacturing and sales of studded tires by March 1991.
