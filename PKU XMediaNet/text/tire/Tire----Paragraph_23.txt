Materials science research efforts are underway to improve such properties of elastomers. For instance, this involves modifying the microstructure of the copolymer (for instance, using solution styrene butadiene rubber (S-SBR) to control the addition of vinyl butadiene units) as well as the macrostructure of the polymer (such as the width of molecular weight distribution (MWD)). Current investigation also involves looking at the functionalization of the elastomer through the addition of filler materials such as silica and carbon black, as well as testing other nano-fillers such as nanocellulose crystals, carbon nanotubes, and graphene.
