Snow tires are only required by law in certain mountainous regions. In these areas, motorists must use Winter tires or carry tire chains. Studded snow tires with studs up to 3.5 mm in length are permitted between October 1 and April 30. Regulations limit the number of studs to fewer than 130 per tire on vehicles weighing less than 4,600 kg.
