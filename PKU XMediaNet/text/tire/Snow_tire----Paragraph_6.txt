Expressways and other controlled-access highway have mandatory snow tire restrictions in advance when snowfall is expected. Snow tire checkpoints are often set up in the early winter or on the roads leading to snow country to ensure all vehicles are fitted with appropriate snow tires with good tread depth. In addition, regions prone to severe snow and ice accumulation may require a tire chain to be fitted on top of the snow tires.
