Studded tires with metal pins that protrude from the tire can greatly reduce skidding and accidents on snow or ice-covered roads. However, the metal studs make contact with the road pavement and eventually cut into the pavement, allowing water to get in. The water can cause road damage and create hydroplaning hazard.
