Outside of national parks, there are no requirements for winter tires. In extreme conditions, peace officers can shut off roadways and only allow vehicles with sufficient equipment (e.g. winter tires) to drive through. Studded tires and snow chains can only be used if road ways are not damaged, per section 51 of Alberta's Highway Development and Protection Act.
