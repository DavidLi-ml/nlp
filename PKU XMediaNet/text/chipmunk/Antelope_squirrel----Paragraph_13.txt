The typical life span of a wild antelope squirrel is 2â€“4 years; although, in captivity they have been known to survive 11 years. Males and females are sexually mature by the end of their first year. The reproductive season last from February to March with typically one liter per year. Each litter contains between 5-14 young that will wean around 8 weeks and make their first appearance above ground. All antelope squirrels give birth to and nurse their young in burrows. However, they do vary in the way they dig the burrows. For example, the white-tailed squirrel digs shallow burrows under brush or will use the abandoned burrows of kangaroo rats. These squirrels are not monogamous and have been known to mate with multiple partners each breeding season.
