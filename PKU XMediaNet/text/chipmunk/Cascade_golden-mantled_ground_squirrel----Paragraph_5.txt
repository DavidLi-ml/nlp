S. saturatus have been noted to move in two distinct ways – walking (mean speed of .21 m/s) and running (mean speed of 3.63 m/s). 26.9% of total time spent daily above ground was spent walking, while only 3.6% was spent running. It is noted that individuals run at their maximum aerobic speed of 3.6 m/s instead of the more maintainable minimum running pace of 2 m/s in order to minimize predation. S. saturatus moved an average of 5 km/day – 1.5 km walking and 3.3 km running. This considerable distance required 28.75 kJ/day of net added energy cost to do so, a 29% increase above BMR and 13% of daily energy expenditure.
