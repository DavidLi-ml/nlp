A. nelsoni are yellowish-brown or buffy-tan on the dorsal had and neck and outer surface of the limbs. The tail is thicker than the other ground squirrels with fringes. The males are slightly larger than the females with a length of 234–267 millimetres (9.2–10.5 in) and 230–256 millimetres (9.1–10.1 in), respectively. The summer and winter pelages are distinctive with the winter pelage being much darker. These can be distinguished from the White-tailed squirrels by their larger size and more grey in their pelage. Their skulls also vary in the size of the zygomatic arch (larger in Nelson's) and the inflated auditory bullae and nasal bones of A. nelsoni. The upper incisors and first upper molars are also larger.
