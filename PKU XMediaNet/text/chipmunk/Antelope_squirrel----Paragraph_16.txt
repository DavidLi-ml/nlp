A. leucurus have larger feet than other antelope squirrels, which allow them to quickly evade and escape predators. They remain cool during the hot desert days by retreating to their burrows and limiting the majority of activity to the early morning and late evening hours. Some white-tailed squirrels have been known to sound shrill alarm calls when predators are nearby to warn relatives of incoming danger.
