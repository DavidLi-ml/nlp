The yellow-cheeked chipmunk is endemic to the coast region of northern California where it is present in a strip of land nowhere wider than 40 kilometres (25 mi). The southern end of its range is a few kilometers north of Bodego Bay and Freestone in Sonoma County and the northern end is the Eel River in Humboldt County. It occurs at altitudes of up to 1,280 metres (4,200 ft) in the humid coastal strip of coniferous forest where there is an understorey of shrubby growth.
