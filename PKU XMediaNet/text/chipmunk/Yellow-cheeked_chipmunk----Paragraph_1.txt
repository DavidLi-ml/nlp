The yellow-cheeked chipmunk is the largest species in the genus Neotamias and grows to a total length of 233 to 297 mm (9.2 to 11.7 in) including a tail of 97 to 130 mm (3.8 to 5.1 in). It is a dark, tawny olive with five dark longitudinal stripes on the body, the central one along the spine being the most prominent, and three on the head, where the dark stripe running through the eye has pale stripes on either side. There is a pale patch of fur immediately behind the ear. The sides of the body are ochre which gradually fades to the paler underparts, where there are dark gray guard hairs tipped with white. The bushy tail is dorso-ventrally flattened, the upper surface being the same color as the body and the underside being reddish-brown to orange. The guard hairs on the tail are also tipped with white. It moults in the fall and the fur in the winter is duller colored, longer and silkier.
