The yellow-cheeked chipmunk is secretive in its habits and rarely seen, but it can be heard emitting its characteristic shrill double-syllable "chuck-chuck" call which is relatively low-pitched compared to other chipmunk species. This is repeated at regular intervals and is most similar to the call of Townsend's chipmunk (Neotamias townsendii). Little is known of the reproductive habits of the yellow-cheeked chipmunk but a female carrying four fetuses was caught in March and the testes of males are largest from March to June.
