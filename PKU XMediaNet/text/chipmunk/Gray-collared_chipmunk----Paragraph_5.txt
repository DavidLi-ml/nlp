The gray-collared chipmunk is listed by the IUCN as being of "least concern". This is because within its range it is common, it faces no major threats and its population size appears to be steady. In suitable habitat in Arizona it was estimated to be present at the rate of five individuals per hectare in April, increasing to twelve per hectare in August.
