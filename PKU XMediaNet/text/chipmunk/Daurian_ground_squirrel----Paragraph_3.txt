This ground squirrel lives in open plains and on the fringes of desert areas such as the northern edge of the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. It is a colonial species, digging relatively simple burrows which usually have just two entrance holes. The tunnels seldom exceed two metres in length though they occasionally extend much further. The young are born in the spring in a grass-lined nest at a depth of half a metre. Litter size varies between two and nine. The diet consists of the green parts of plants, seeds and grain.
