The Nubian wild ass hasn't been seen since the 1950s-70s and is presumed extinct. The last sighting of wild asses in the animal's range were in Eritrea's Barka Valley and the border between Eritrea and Sudan during aerial flights in the 1970s. Similar to the decline of the Somali wild ass, the Nubian wild ass' extinction can largely be attributed to hunting, competition with livestock for limited desert resources, and hybridization with the Domestic donkey.
