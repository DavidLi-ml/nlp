In the Middle East to the Indian Subcontinent, Asiatic lions and tigers were the biggest predators to onagers, just as African lions are to zebras. They were also formerly by Asiatic wild dogs, Asiatic cheetahs and possibly bears in their former neighboring ranges, though they may have mostly preyed on onager foals. In South Asia, mugger crocodiles can be great threats to onagers during migratory river crossings.
