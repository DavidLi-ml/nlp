Based on ancient drawings, the Atlas wild ass had stripes on its legs as well as a shoulder cross. Of the living subspecies of African wild ass, the Somali wild ass has only leg stripes, and the Nubian wild ass only the shoulder stripe. One or both features appear sometimes in the domestic donkey, the domestic descendant of the African wild asses.
