Donkey's milk is used as a substitute for human milk due its lactose, proteins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acid content. Donkey milk contains immune-enhancing compounds (in particular lysozyme and lactoferrin) to help protect infants from infection and disease. In addition, the flavour and appearance of donkey milk have been found to be attractive to children.
