Donkey milk is used as a natural hypoallergenic milk, because it is tolerated by about 90% of infants with food allergies, e.g., cowsâ€™ milk protein allergy (CMPA), a common food allergy in childhood with a prevalence of approximately 3% during the first 3 years of life. However the infants tolerance of donkey milk must be evaluated first subjectively, under medical supervision and after carrying out specific allergic tests.
