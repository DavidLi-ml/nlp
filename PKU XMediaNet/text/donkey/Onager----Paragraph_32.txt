Currently, the biggest predator for onagers are gray wolves. Investigations revealed that a 23% of prey proportion of gray wolves were attributed to the Asian wild ass. However, like most equids, they are known to have anti-predator protection. Groups of stallions cooperate and try to chase off predators. If threatened, onagers defend themselves and violently kick at the incoming predator.
