The onager (Equus hemionus) (pronounced /ˈä-ni-jər/), also known as hemione or Asiatic wild ass, is a large equid of the family Equidae (horse family) native to Asia. A member of the subgenus Asinus, the onager was described and given its binomial name by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1775. Five subspecies have been recognized, one of which is extinct.
