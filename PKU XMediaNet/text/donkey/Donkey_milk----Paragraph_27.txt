Concluding, the treatment of lyophilization (freeze dried) of donkeyâ€™s milk demonstrated that the natural colour, flavours, nutrients, bioactive substances of the fresh donkey milk are retained. Instead, with the spray-drying method, another way to dry products, the milk is being heated whereby vitamins and other important bioactive substances will get lost. In addition Freeze-dried don't require chemical preservatives and can be either consumed directly or re hydrated easily. However, this method for its high costs is practiced only by a few companies.
