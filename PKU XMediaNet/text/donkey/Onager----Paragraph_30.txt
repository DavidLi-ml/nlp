The onager is preyed upon by apex predators such as Asiatic leopards and striped hyenas. A few cases of onager deaths due to predation by leopards was recorded in Iran, as a Persian leopard attacked and eaten a Persian onager. Though it is said that leopards do not usually feed on equids such as in Africa, it may be due that Asian leopards are larger and stronger enough to prey on Asiatic wild asses.
