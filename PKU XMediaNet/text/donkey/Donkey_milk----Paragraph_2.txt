Hippocrates (460 – 370 BC), the father of medicine, was the first to write of the medicinal virtues of donkey milk. In the Roman era donkey milk was recognized as a common remedy, Pliny the Elder (23 – 79 AD) in his encyclopedic work, Naturalis Historia, wrote extensively about its health benefits, but it wasn’t until the Renaissance that the first real scientific consideration was given to donkey milk. Subsequently, the famous French naturalist, Georges-Louis Leclerc(1707- 1788) mentions the benefits of donkey milk in his Histoire naturelle  and Pauline Bonaparte (1780-1825), Napoleon’s sister, is also reported to have used Donkey milk for her skin’s health care. In France in the nineteenth century, Dr .Parrot of Hospital des Enfants Assistès spread the practice of bringing babies motherless directly to the donkey’s nipple (Bullettin de l’Acadèmie de mèdicine, 1882). The donkey’s milk was then sold until the twentieth century to feed orphaned infants and to cure delicate children, the sick and the elderly. For this reason, in Italy, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland many donkeys are born on farms.
