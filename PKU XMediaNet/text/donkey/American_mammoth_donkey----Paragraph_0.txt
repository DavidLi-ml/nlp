The American mammoth donkey, commonly known as the mammoth jack, American mammoth or American mammoth jack is a landrace of North American donkey, descended from multiple breeds of donkey imported to the United States. George Washington, with Henry Clay and others, bred for an ass that could be used to produce strong work mules. Washington was offering his jacks for stud service by 1788. Large breeds of asses were found in Kentucky by 1800.
