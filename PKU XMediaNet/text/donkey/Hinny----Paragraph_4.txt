Other than size, some additional minor differences occur that can be used to distinguish between mules and hinnies. The head of a hinny is said to resemble that of a horse more than it does a mule's, with shorter ears (although these are still longer than those of horses), and more horse-like manes and tails than mules. A male hinny is properly called a horse hinny, and a female hinny is properly called a mare hinny. In England, a hinny is commonly called a jennet.
