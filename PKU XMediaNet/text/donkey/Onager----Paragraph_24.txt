Southern populations of onagers in the Middle East and South Asia tend to have a purely territorial life, where areas partly overlap. Dominant stallions home ranges of 9 km2 (3.5 sq mi), but can also be significantly larger. These territories include food and rest stops and permanent or periodic water sources. The waters are but usually at the edge of a coalfield and not in the center. Frequently committed paths with feces and marked urine, where often the same marker points are used. Mares with foals sometimes find themselves also to small groups, the areas of up to 20 km2 (7.7 sq mi) which overlap with those of the other groups and dominant stallions. Such features are seen in Gr√©vy's zebras (Equus grevyi) and the African wild asses.
