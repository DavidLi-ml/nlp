The social behavior of the Asian wild ass can be very different, depending on different habitats, ranges and even threats by predators and humans. In Mongolia and Central Asia (Equus hemionus hemionus and Equus hemionus kulan), a stove onager stallion can adopt harem-type social groups with several mares and foals in large home areas in the southwest and territory-based social groups in the south and southeast. Also, annual large hikes occur 45 km2 (17 sq mi) to 40 km2 (15 sq mi), where hiking in summer are more limited than in the winter. Partially, onagers also form large group associations of up from 450 to 1,200 individuals, but this usually only takes place on locations with food or water sources. Since dissolving these major units within one day again, there seems to be no overarching hierarchy next to the ranking of the individual herds. There are also "bachelor groups" that young male onagers frequently make during the winter. Such a lifestyle is also seen in the wild horse, the plains zebras (Equus quagga) and mountain zebras (Equus zebra). However, occasional formation of temporary territories can be defended in an aggressive way.
