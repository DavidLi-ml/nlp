Donkey milk production differs greatly from that of conventional dairy species, especially in terms of milk supply which is much more limited. The equid mammary gland has a low capacity (max 2,5 L) and a part of the milk production should be left to the foal and that milking may be carried out two or three hours after separation from the foal. Donkeys should be milked from 20 to 90 d after foaling for three times a day. A female gives between 0.5 and 1.3 litres of milk a day for about 6â€“7 months. . The variability of donkey milk production is due to many factors, such as individual milkability, nutrition, genetics, management of reproduction, etc., in addition to milking management.
