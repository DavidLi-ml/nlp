The Iberian magpie occurs in southwestern and central parts of the Iberian Peninsula, in Spain and Portugal. This taxon is usually treated as conspecific with azure-winged magpie C. cyana, but this population is 9,000 km away from those in eastern Asia. Recent genetic analysis has shown that the Iberian magpie and the azure-winged magpie are distinct at species level.
