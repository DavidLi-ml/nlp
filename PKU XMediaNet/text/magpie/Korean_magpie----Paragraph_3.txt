Recent research comparing 813 bp mtDNA sequences indicates that either all Pica magpies should be considered races of one species, or that P. p. sericea needs to be separated as a distinct species; it has been reproductively isolated for longer even than the yellow-billed magpie (P. nuttalli) of North America. Hence, pending more comprehensive studies, the species binomen is put into parentheses, indicating that this bird may or may not be considered distinct. The large magpies found from the eastern Himalayas region to southern China (Tibetan magpie or black-rumped magpie, P. p. bottanensis) could belong to sericea if that is split off as a species. The relationships of P. p. leucoptera, found north of the arid lands of Mongolia, is yet to be determined, but the similar-looking subspecies from Kamchatka Krai and its surroundings (P. p. camtschatica) is the easternmost population of the "European" magpie. Of particularly interest is also the population called P. p. jankowskii (which is often included in sericea); this taxon refers to the birds found north of Korea, towards the range of leucoptera. P. p. japonica from southern Japan is usually included in sericea today.
