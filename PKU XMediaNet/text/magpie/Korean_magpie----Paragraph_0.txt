The Korean magpie or Oriental magpie Pica (pica) sericea, known as "kkachi" (까치) in Korean, is generally treated as an East Asian subspecies of the European magpie (Pica pica), but it may be a distinct species. It is a common symbol of the Korean identity, and has been adopted as the "official bird" of numerous South Korean cities, counties and provinces. But it is not limited to the Korean Peninsula and if considered a valid species its range may extend almost to the Himalayas. Consequently, other vernacular names may be used for this bird, e.g. Asian magpie.
