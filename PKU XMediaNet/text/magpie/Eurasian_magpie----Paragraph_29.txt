A study conducted near Sheffield in Britain using birds with coloured rings on their legs found that only 22 per cent of fledglings survived their first year. For subsequent years the survival rate for the adult birds was 69 per cent implying that for those birds that survive the first year the average total lifespan was 3.7 years. The maximum age recorded for a magpie is 21 years and 8 months for a bird from near Coventry in England that was ringed in 1925 and shot in 1947.
