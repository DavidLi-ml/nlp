Similar to other members of the crow family, they have a raucous call which is described as a high pitched cackling chatter, "kyak-kyak-kyak-kyak", and they are well known scavengers and omnivores. Their diet includes snakes, rodents, small insects, plants, fruits, and seeds. Wild figs and papayas are their favorites. They are known to store leftovers on the ground and cover them with leaves for future retrievals. Sometimes they store food in the leaves or branches.
