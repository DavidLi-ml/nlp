The Taiwan blue magpie is monogamous. Females incubate eggs while males help out with nest building and feeding. Their nests are usually found in the woods and weeds rendezvous areas and are mostly built on higher branches from March to April. The nest shapes like a bowl and is weaved with twigs and weeds. Usually there are 3–8 eggs in a clutch. Eggs are olive green in color, with dark brown marks. Hatching takes 17–19 days and the success rate is 78.3%. This will yield 3–7 chicks per nest. Taiwan blue magpies have a strong nest defence behaviour, and will attack intruders mercilessly until they retreat.
