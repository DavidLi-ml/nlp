The Australian magpie was subdivided into three species in the literature for much of the twentieth centuryâ€”the black-backed magpie (C. tibicen), the white-backed magpie (C. hypoleuca), and the western magpie (C. dorsalis). They were later noted to hybridise readily where their territories crossed, with hybrid grey or striped-backed magpies being quite common. This resulted in them being reclassified as one species by Julian Ford in 1969, with most recent authors following suit.
