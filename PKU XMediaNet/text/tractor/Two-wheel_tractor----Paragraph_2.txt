There is also a fair bit of confusion in nomenclature regarding machines of similar size/configuration, that operate a single implement (such as power tillers; rear-tine tillers; rotary hoes; rotary ploughs; rotary tillers; Rotavators; etc.) The important distinction between a two-wheel tractor and any of these machines is that the two-wheel tractor is a single-axle, walk-behind machine designed to operate multiple interchangeable implements, where machines in the categories above typically only operate one implement (such as a tiller), which implement is often integral to the machine (rather than being removable).
