Today, the Ariens Company continues, and Gravely is now a subsidiary of Ariens. Gravely [Ariens] discontinued the production of their own two-wheel tractor in 2002. Since then, they for a short time imported a Swiss machine (the Rapid brand) and sold it under the Gravely label; they have discontinued this as well.
