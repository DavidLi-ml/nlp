Grillo spa began in the Romagna region in the early 1950s developing a farm hoe for weeding in fruit orchards. In 1953 the first Grillo walking tractor was born. The Grillo winning idea was to detach the motorized tractor from the attachments. It became possible to fit tines, ploughs, and trailers, and via fitting a water pump it was possible to irrigate. In 1955 the factory started the first series production of 15 different models per year. In 1957 "Grillo" became the name of the factory (formerly Pinza) and a brand. In the late 1960s, Grillo formed a technology-sharing venture with the Italian manufacturer BCS, with the goal of expanding their versatility in implement types to include mowing and other front-PTO applications. The two companies worked together until the early 1980s. In the 1980s the company experienced a considerable growth in garden machines, and also in lawn-care equipment; In that decade the Grillo research and development department created the first Italian lawnmower with a double hydrostatic system. Today thousands of machines are sold throughout the world annually. The name "Grillo" means "Cricket" in Italian.
