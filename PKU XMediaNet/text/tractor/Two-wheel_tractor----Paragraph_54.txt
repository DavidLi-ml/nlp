BCS was founded in 1943 by Luigi Castoldi in his workshop in Abbiategrasso, a small town near Milan. The area was and still is highly agricultural. For this reason the motor-mower (essentially an engine-driven, walk-behind sickle-bar mower) model 243 was created. This was among the first self-propelled motor-mowers in the world. At the end of the 1960s BCS entered into a technology-sharing venture with the Grillo company of Italy, the goal being to integrate soil-working implements into the BCS line. This venture lasted until the early 1980s, and served to launch BCS into the field of green maintenance machines by producing their first “light” multipurpose two-wheel tractors. Starting in 1970, BCS introduced rotary disc-mowers (for 4-wheel tractor mounting). In 1988 BCS purchased Ferrari at Luzzara and in 1999 BCS purchased Pasquali at Calenzano; these acquisitions strengthened BCS Group's divisions with two brands with an international reputation, and since Ferrari and Pasquali produced 4-wheel tractors, these purchases allowed BCS to move into the 4-wheel tractor market. BCS Group presently counts on three production plants (Abbiategrasso, Luzzara, and Cusago) and on six branches.
