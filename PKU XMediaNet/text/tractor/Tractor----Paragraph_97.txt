 Nebraska tractor tests: Tests, mandated by a Nebraska law and administered by the University of Nebraska, that objectively tested the performance of all brands sold in Nebraska. In the 1920s and 1930s, an era of snake oil sales and advertising tactics, the Nebraska tests helped farmers throughout North America to see through marketing claims and make informed buying decisions. The tests continue today, making sure the snake oil, which has mostly been vanquished, stays that way.
