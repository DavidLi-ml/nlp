A kuliglig is a vehicle composed of a two-wheeled trailer pulled by a two-wheeled tractor similar to a rotary tiller. It is powered by multi-purpose diesel or gasoline engine, commonly used in the provinces of the Philippines. The kuliglig traces its etymology from the Filipino term kuliglig, meaning "cicada" (a type of insect) which was adopted by one manufacturer as a brand.
