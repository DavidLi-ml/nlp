As early as 1911, Benjamin Franklin Gravely of Charleston West Virginia began with connecting the Indian motorcycle to a manually operated push plow. In 1916 he incorporated and, after obtaining partners, began producing single-wheel tractors and attachments under the name Gravely Tractor. The Model "D" Gravely Power Plow, like the prototype, was a single-wheeled affair, with a 2 horsepower (1.5 kW) air-cooled engine. It wasn't until 1937 that Gravely would introduce the Model L two-wheeled tractor with a 5 horsepower (3.7 kW) engine. Through the 20th century, Gravely became arguably one of the most successful and recognizable two-weeled tractors produced in the United States, at one point offering 120 individual attachments for their all-gear drive machines.
