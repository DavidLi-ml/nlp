For production agriculture, past and present, two-wheel tractors accept a wide range implements, such as the following: For soil-working: rototillers, moldboard plows, disc-plows, rotary plows, root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, powered and non-powered harrows, seeders, transplanters, and planters. Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle bar mowers, disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, haybalers and bale wrappers [for silage production]. For grain harvest: reaper/grain harvesters, reaper-binders, and even combine harvesters are available [although typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors]. For transport, trailers with capacities from 0.5 to 5 plus ton cargoes are available. General mowing implements consist of lawn mowers, brush mowers, and flail mowers. For snow removal, implements consist of snowblowers, power sweepers, and snow/dozer blades. Other implements include: chipper/shredders, log splitters, electrical generator, pressure washer, crimper-roller, fertilizer/salt/lime spreader, and stump grinder. This list of implements (which may not be complete) means that two-wheel tractors can execute practically all of the chores done by larger 4-wheel tractors, with the exception of items like front-loaders, which obviously have the physical stability requirements of a 4-wheel (two-axle) tractor.
