Starting after World War II, many countries in Europe started producing two-wheel tractors, most notably Italy. In 2014, Italy had over 15 manufacturers of two-wheel tractors. Starting in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many European two-wheel tractors underwent an "evolution" which sharply contrasted them from the Asian and American machines: The introduction of fully reversible handlebars, allowing the machine's PTO (Power Take Off, where implements are mounted) to be effectively in the front OR rear of the tractor, depending on handlebar position. This allowed much safer and more practical operation of a wider range of implements. (For example: when using a mowing implement, the handlebars would be located OPPOSITE the PTO, so the PTO, and therefore the mowing implement, would be in "front" of the tractor. Conversely, for tillage tools, the handlebars would be located on the SAME SIDE of the machine as the PTO, putting the PTO/implement in the rear, so tire tracks are not left on the worked soil.) Only very recently (since 2005) have any Asian manufacturers added this feature to their machines at all, and the bulk of Asian machines are still produced without this feature.
