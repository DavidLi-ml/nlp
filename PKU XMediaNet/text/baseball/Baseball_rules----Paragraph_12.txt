After that, the rules remained virtually static for decades. In 1961, the 162-game schedule was adopted. In 1969, the pitcher's mound was dropped five inches and the strike zone reduced: from the armpits to the top of the knees. In 1973, the American League adopted the designated hitter ruleâ€”rejected to this day by the National League. This was probably the most controversial rule change in baseball's history, and is still subject to lively debate. Also controversial when adopted, although more generally accepted now, was the later introduction of inter-league play. The most recent significant rule changes, banning the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing substances, have had widespread support as protecting the integrity of the game. The use of steroids by many players over the last two decades has called into question a number of baseball records for both hitting and pitching.
