Numbered counterclockwise, first, second and third bases are cushions (sometimes informally referred to as bags) shaped as 15 in (38 cm) squares which are raised a short distance above the ground; together with home plate, the fourth "base", they form a square with sides of 90 ft (27.4 m) called the diamond. Home base (usually called home plate) is a pentagonal rubber slab 17 in (43.2 cm) wide. The playing field is divided into three main sections:
