Rule changes have been implemented at different levels of baseball to quicken the pace of the game. In college baseball, the Southeastern Conference experimented with a 20-second pitch clock during the 2010 season, and the NCAA instituted the pitch clock before the 2011 season for when no runners are on base. The pitch clock began to be used in professional baseball as well, first in the Arizona Fall League in 2014 and in the Double-A and Triple-A levels of Minor League baseball in 2015.
