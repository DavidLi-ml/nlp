A runner legally touching a base is "safe" â€” in most situations he may not be put out. Runners may attempt to advance from base to base at any time (except when the ball is dead), but must attempt to advance when forced when all previous bases are occupied and a batted ball that touches the ground is a fair ball. When a batted ball is hit in the air, i.e., a fly ball, and caught by the defending team, runners must return and "retouch" the base they occupied at the time of the pitch. The common name for this requirement is tagging up. If the runner retouches the origin base at any time after the fly ball is first touched by a fielder, he may attempt to advance to the next base or bases at his own risk. The penalty for failing to retouch (if the defensive team notices this) is that the advancing runner can be put out on a live appeal in which the defensive team player with the ball touches the base from which that runner departed prematurely, a process that looks like a force play to the eye, but technically is not because runners are not "forced" backwards to their origin bases. If a runner tries to run the next base in sequence, they can be deemed out by either of two methods. The runner may be tagged by the infielder, or the runner may fail to reach the base before the baseball has arrived at it. However, if the runner is not forced to run to the next base in sequence, they are not deemed out until they are tagged. The runner, however, cannot take a base that is occupied by a fieldman holding the baseball.
