The generally static nature of baseball's rules in the modern era has been a source of the sport's appeal to many fans, as it allows reasonable if imperfect comparisons to be drawn between players and teams of different eras. Such comparisons are not possible in sports in which the rules have changed significantly over the years. The generally static nature of the rules in the modern era also allows a modern fan to easily follow an account of a game played long ago. As a result, baseball arguably has more of a "history" than most other sports.
