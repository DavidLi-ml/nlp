Any replacement is a permanent substitution; the replaced player may not return to the game under any circumstances. Thus, a pitcher that has been removed from the game and replaced by a relief pitcher cannot return to pitch later in the game, and any batter who is replaced by a pinch-hitter cannot take the field in the following inning (or even bat again if his turn comes up again in the same inning). Note however, that two players can switch defensive positions at any time, and both can still stay in the gameâ€”because neither has actually been removed from the game. This means that in at least one case, a pitcher switched positions with an outfielder in the middle of the game, with the outfielder becoming a relief pitcher ... then later in the game, the players switched back. This meant that in practical terms, the starting pitcher was relieved by another pitcher, but then came back to relieve the relief pitcher. This game took place on September 28, 1952: the players in question were starting pitcher Harvey Haddix, who moved to the outfield to make way for outfielder-turned relief pitcher Stan Musial, then switched back to pitcher after Musial had faced one batter. Note that this did not violate baseball's permanent substitution rule in any way, as at no time did either player leave the game.
