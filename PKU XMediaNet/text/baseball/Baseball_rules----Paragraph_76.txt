In the postseason, rosters are fixed at 25 men. Until 2007, teams could not replace players on their playoff rosters in the event of an injury and had to play out the series shorthanded. Starting in 2007, an injured player could be placed on the disabled list and replaced by another player not included on the initial 25-man roster, but the injured player is no longer available for the next round of the playoffs should his team advance due to his being on the DL.
