Shortly after Apaches were deployed to Hamid Karzai International Airport, as part of the Netherlands contribution to ISAF, on 10 April 2004 a pair of Dutch Apaches came under light gunfire close to the Afghan capital. On 17 December 2007, an RNLAF Apache flew into powerlines during a night flying exercise in the Netherlands, forcing an emergency landing and causing a lengthy blackout in the region. On 17 March 2015 a RNLAF Apache crashed during a training mission in Mali. Both pilots died. The ministry of defence opened an investigation into the cause of the crash.
