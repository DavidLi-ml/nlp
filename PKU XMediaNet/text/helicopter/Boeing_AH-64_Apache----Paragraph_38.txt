Since recent orders of new AH-64Ds have been blocked, Israel has pursued upgrades to its AH-64A fleet. In June 2010, Israel decided not to upgrade all AH-64As to D configuration, due to funding constraints and lack of U.S. cooperation. In December 2010, the IAF was examining the adoption of a new missile system as a cheaper and lightweight complement to the Hellfire missile, either the American Hydra 70 or the Canadian CRV7. In 2013, Israeli AH-64As had been receiving a comprehensive upgrade of their avionics and electrical systems. The AH-64As are being upgraded to the AH-64Ai configuration, which is near the AH-64D standard.
