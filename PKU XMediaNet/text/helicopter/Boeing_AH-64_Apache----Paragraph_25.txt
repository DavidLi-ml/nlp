While effective in combat, the AH-64 also presented serious logistical complications. Findings reported in 1990 stated "maintenance units could not keep up with the Apacheâ€™s unexpectedly high work load..." To provide spare parts for combat operations, the U.S. Army unofficially grounded all other AH-64s worldwide; Apaches in the theater flew only one-fifth of the planned flight-hours. These problems were evident before the Gulf War.
