The Israeli Air Force (IAF) first received AH-64As in 1990, for a total fleet of 42. There was some controversy over the Air Force's choice to purchase Apaches over upgrading existing AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters. In 2000, Israel was interested in acquiring up to 48 AH-64Ds, but U.S. reluctance to share the software source code complicated the prospect. In April 2005, Boeing delivered the first AH-64D to the IAF. In 2001, the U.S. government was allegedly investigating misuse of the Apache and other US-supplied military equipment against Palestinian leaders and facilities. In 2009, an arranged sale of six AH-64Ds was reportedly blocked by the Obama Administration, pending interagency review, over concerns the helicopters may pose a threat to civilian Palestinians in Gaza. In IAF service, the AH-64A was named as the Peten (Hebrew: פתן‎‎, for Cobra), while the AH-64D was named Saraph (שרף, also as "Seraph", Hebrew for venomous/fiery winged serpent).
