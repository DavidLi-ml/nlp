In 2009, South Korea showed interest in acquiring Apaches. This move may be related to U.S. plans to withdraw many of its Apaches from South Korea. On 21 September 2012, the U.S. Congress was notified of the possible purchase of 36 AH-64D Block III Apaches, along with associated equipment and armament. The Apache competed against the Bell AH-1Z Viper and the TAI/AgustaWestland T-129; in April 2013, South Korea announced that it would purchase 36 AH-64Es. The first four AH-64Es were delivered in May 2016, with all to be delivered by early 2017.
