Early balloons were simple round spheres, with a payload hung beneath. The round shape uses the minimum material to accommodate a given volume of lifting gas, making it the lightest construction. However in any significant wind the round shape is aerodynamically unstable and will bob about, risking damage or the balloon breaking free.
