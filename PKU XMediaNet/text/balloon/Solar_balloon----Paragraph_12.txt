At sea level at 15째C at ISA (International Standard Atmosphere), air has a density of approximately 1.22521 kg/m3. The density of air decreases with higher temperatures, at the rate of around 20 grams per m3 per 5 K. Around 1 kilojoules of energy is needed to heat 1 kilogram of dry air by one kelvin (see heat capacity). So, to increase the temperature of 1 m3 of air (at sea level and at 15째C) 5째C requires around 5째C * 1 kilojoules/(kilogram*kelvin) * 1.225 kilograms = 6.125 kilojoules. By doing so, you've reduced the mass of 1 m3 of air by around 24 grams. On a clear day with a black body surface of 1 m2 perpendicular to the sun and no heat loss, this would take a little over 6 seconds.
