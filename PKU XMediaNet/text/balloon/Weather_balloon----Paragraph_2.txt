The balloon itself produces the lift, and is usually made of a highly flexible latex material, though Chloroprene may also be used. The unit that performs the actual measurements and radio transmissions hangs at the lower end of the string, and is called a radiosonde. Specialized radiosondes are used for measuring particular parameters, such as determining the ozone concentration. An example of specialized measurements is found in the Tethered Balloon Measurements in Cyprus in 2003, as part of the Preliminary Evaluation of Air Quality in Cyprus,.
