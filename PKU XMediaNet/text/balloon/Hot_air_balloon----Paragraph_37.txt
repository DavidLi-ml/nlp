A handling or drop line is mandatory safety equipment in many countries. This is a rope or webbing of 20â€“30 meters in length attached to the balloon basket with a quick release connection at one end. In very calm winds the balloon pilot can throw the handling line from the balloon so that the ground crew can guide the balloon safely away from obstructions on the ground.
