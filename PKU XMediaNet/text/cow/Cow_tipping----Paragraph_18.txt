In the United States and Canada, a form of vandalism involving Smart cars being flipped on their sides has been described. In 2009, the Toronto Star featured "reports that vandals may be targeting the tiny vehicles in a 21st-century take on tipping cows" in Amsterdam, Edmonton, and elsewhere; and a 2014 article in USA Today used the phrase "urban cow tipping" to describe the act. The Star noted that at 725 kilograms (1,598 lb), the small cars weigh about the same as a mature cow.
