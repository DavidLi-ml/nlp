The Red Heifer (Hebrew: פָרָ֨ה אֲדֻמָּ֜ה‎‎; para adumma), also known as the red cow, was a cow brought to the priests as a sacrifice according to the Hebrew Bible, and its ashes were used for the ritual purification of Ṭum'at HaMet ("the impurity of the dead"), that is, an Israelite who had come into contact with a corpse.
