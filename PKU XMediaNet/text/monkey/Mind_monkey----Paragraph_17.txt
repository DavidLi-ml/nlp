Besides the "mind-monkey idea-horse" metaphor, monkeys and horses have further associations. In Chinese astrology, wu 午 "Horse" and shen 申 "Monkey" are the 7th and 9th of the 12 zodiacal animals. In Chinese animal mythology, monkeys supposedly bring good health to horses. The Bencao Gangmu (tr. Read 1931, no. 400) records the "custom of keeping a female monkey in the horse's stable to ward off sickness (the menstrual discharge of the monkey is said to give immunity to the horse against infectious diseases)".
