Most howler species live in groups of six to 15 animals, with one to three adult males and multiple females. Mantled howler monkeys are an exception, commonly living in groups of 15 to 20 individuals with more than three adult males. The number of males in a given group is negatively correlated with the size of their hyoid, and is positively correlated with testes size. This results in two distinct groups, wherein there is one male, who has a larger hyoid, and smaller testes, who copulates exclusively with a group of females. The other group has more males, who have smaller hyoids, and larger testes, and there is free copulation among the group. The larger the number of males, the smaller the hyoid, and the larger the testes. Unlike most New World monkeys, in which one sex remains in natal groups, juveniles of both sexes emigrate from their natal groups, such that howler monkeys could spend the majority of their adult lives in association with unrelated monkeys.
