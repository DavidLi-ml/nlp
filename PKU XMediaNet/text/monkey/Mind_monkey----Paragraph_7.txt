For example, take the Buddhist word Chinese xin-yi-shi or Japanese shin-i-shiki 心意識 [lit. "mind, thought, and cognition"] that compounds three near-synonyms. Abhidharma theory uses this word as a general term for "mind; mentality", but Yogacara theory of Eight Consciousnesses distinguishes xin/shin 心 "store consciousness", yi/i 意 "manas consciousness", and shi/shiki 識 "six object-contingent consciousnesses".
