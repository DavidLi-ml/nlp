The psychological components of the "mind-monkey will-horse" metaphor are Chinese xin or Sino-Japanese shin or kokoro 心 "heart; mind; feelings, affections; center" and yi or i 意 'thought, idea; opinion, sentiment; will, wish; meaning'. This Chinese character 心 was graphically simplified from an original pictogram of a heart, and 意 "thought; think" is an ideogram combining 心 under yin 音 "sound; tone; voice" denoting "sound in the mind; thought; idea".
