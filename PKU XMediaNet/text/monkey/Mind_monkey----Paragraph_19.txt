Chinese authors coined "mind monkey" expressions from the Later Qin Dynasty (384-417 CE) through the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE). In modern usage, some terms are considered Classical Chinese, but others like xinyuanyima "mind-monkey will-horse" are Modern Standard Chinese. Unless otherwise noted, translations are by Carr (1993:154-159).
