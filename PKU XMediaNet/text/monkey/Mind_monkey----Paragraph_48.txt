In English-language publishing, fewer books are titled with "mind monkey", such as Master the Mind Monkey (Patkar 2007), than "monkey mind". "Taming" is common among Taming the Monkey Mind (Chodron 1999), Taming the Monkey Mind; A Guide to Pure Land Practice (Cheng 2000), and Taming Our Monkey Mind: Insight, Detachment, Identity (Krystal 2007). Other examples of book titles include Samba and the Monkey Mind (Williams 1965), Meeting the Monkey Halfway (Sumano and Popp 2000), Your Monkey Mind Connection (Antoinette 2007), and Still the Monkey (Alivia 2007).
