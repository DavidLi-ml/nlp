   where p is the probability while S is the severity, with k a scaling constant, and to invert the value B is the base. The ceiling function is used to get the domain of priority to only integers. It also assigns priority-B to almost never occurring bugs. Industry standard practice is to use an inverted scale, so that highest priority are low numbers, example priority 0, priority 1, while lowest priority are bigger numbers, i.e. priority 3, priority 4... etc.
