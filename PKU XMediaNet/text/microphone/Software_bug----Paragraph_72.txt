Incompatible systems. Often a proposed "new API" or new communications protocol may seem to work when both computers use the old version or both computers use the new version, but upgrading only the receiver exposes backward compatibility problems; in other cases upgrading only the transmitter exposes forward compatibility problems. Often it is not feasible to upgrade every computer simultaneously—in particular, in the telecommunication industry or the internet. Even when it is feasible to update every computer simultaneously, sometimes people accidentally forget to update every computer—the Knight Capital Group#2012 stock trading disruption involved one such incompatibility between the old API and a new API.
