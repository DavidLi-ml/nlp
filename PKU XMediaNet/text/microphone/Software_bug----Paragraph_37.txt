Given a bug, how fast it needs to get fixed is defined by the software metric priority. How the priority for fixing is used is decided internally by each software producer. Priorities are sometimes numerical and sometimes words, such as "critical," "high," "low" or "deferred"; note that these may be similar or even identical to severity ratings when looking at different software producers. For example, a software company may decide that priority 1 bugs are always to be fixed for the next release, whereas "5" could mean its fix is put off â€“ sometimes indefinitely.
