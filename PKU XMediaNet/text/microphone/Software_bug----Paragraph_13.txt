Another category of bug is called a race condition that may occur when programs have multiple components executing at the same time, either on the same system or across multiple systems interacting across a network. If the components interact in a different order than the developers intended, it may break the logical flow of the program. These bugs may be difficult to detect or anticipate, since they may not occur during every execution of a program.
