Bugs often create inconsistencies in the internal data of a running program. Programs can be written to check the consistency of their own internal data while running. If an inconsistency is encountered the program may immediately halt so that the bug may be located and fixed. Alternatively, the program may simply inform the user, attempt to correct the inconsistency and continue running.
