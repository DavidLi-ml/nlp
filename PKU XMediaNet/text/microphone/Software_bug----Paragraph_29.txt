Sometimes, a bug is not an isolated flaw, but represents an error of thinking or planning on the part of the programmer. Such logic errors require a section of the program to be overhauled or rewritten. As a part of Code review, stepping through the code modelling the execution process in one's head or on paper may often find these errors without ever needing to reproduce the bug as such, if it can be shown there is some faulty logic in its implementation.
