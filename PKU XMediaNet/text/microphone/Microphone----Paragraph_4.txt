German inventor Johann Philipp Reis designed an early sound transmitter that used a metallic strip attached to a vibrating membrane that would produce intermittent current. Better results were achieved with the "liquid transmitter" design in Scottish-American Alexander Graham Bell's telephone of 1876 â€“ the diaphragm was attached to a conductive rod in an acid solution. These systems, however, gave a very poor sound quality.
