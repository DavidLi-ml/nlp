The use of electronic amplification devices, such as loudspeakers or bullhorns, may require permits for "amplified sound". The use of human microphones provides a way for people to address large gatherings without running afoul of such requirements. The human microphone was first used in the anti-nuclear protests in the United States and later in the 1999 Seattle WTO protests.
