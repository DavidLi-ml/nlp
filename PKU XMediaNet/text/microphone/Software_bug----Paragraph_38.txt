If a flaw is found in an application which causes it to crash, yet the crash is so rare and takes, say, ten extremely unusual or unlikely steps to produce it, management may set its priority as "low" or even "will not fix." Thus it is easily seen that Priority is a function of probability of a bug to occur, and Severity (impact) of the bug. In specificity, priority is a strictly increasing function of both probability of the bug occurrence and severity. Given probability p = 1, the severity defines the priority. When p = 0, the bug, in all probability needs not to be fixed at all, however we may have a priority strictly proportional to the severity. In the same way, when Severity S=0 for a bug, we may have a priority strictly proportional to the probability.
