A technology reference study published in 2006 with the ESA proposed an interstellar probe focused on leaving the heliosphere. The goal would be 200 AU in 25 years, with traditional launch but acceleration by a solar sail. The roughly 200â€“300 kg probe would carry a suite of several instruments including a Plasma Analyzer, Plasma radio wave experiment, Magnetometer, Neutral and charged atom detector, Dust analyzer, and a UV-photometer. Electrical power would come from an RTG.
