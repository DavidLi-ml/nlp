An example of RTG used on a probe leaving the Solar system is the Voyagers. Typically these have used Plutonium but an RTG using 241Am was proposed for an interstellar type mission in 2002. This could support mission extensions up to 1000 years on the interstellar probe, because the power output would be more stable in the long-term than plutonium. Other isotopes for RTG were also examined in the study, looking at traits such as watt/gram, half-life, and decay products. An interstellar probe proposal from 1999 suggested using three advanced radioisotope power source. An RTG using 241Am was also studied as RTG fuel by the ESA
