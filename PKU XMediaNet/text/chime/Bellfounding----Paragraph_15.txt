An exact stone model of the outer bell, sometimes called a false bell, is built on a base-plate using porous materials such as coke, stone or brick. It is then covered first with sand or loam sometimes mixed with straw and horse manure. This is given a profile corresponding to the outside shape of the finished bell, and dried with gentle heat. The false bell is then covered with molten wax and figures and inscriptions, also made of wax, applied on top by hand. The false bell is painted over with three coats of fireproof clay and then enclosed by a steel mantle overcasing. The empty space between the false bell and the mantle is filled in with cement and left to harden before the mantle is lifted off. The false bell is chipped away from the inner core to leave just the wax and cement. Any leftover scraps of the false bell are removed with a blow torch. The mould is then set over a coke fire to melt the remaining wax and to evaporate any water that has accumulated.
