After the outer steel mantle has been cleaned, it is again lowered over the outer bell model. The mantle and the outer bell mould are then lowered over the inner mould and the outer and inner sections are clamped together, leaving a space between them. The clamped mould is supported, by being buried in a casting pit which bears the weight of metal and allows even cooling. Ingots of either ready-made bronze or its component metals are melted in a melting furnace and heated until liquid at a temperature of approximately 1,100 °C (2,010 °F). The liquid metal is then skimmed to remove impurities before the start of the casting process. When everything is ready, the molten bronze is transferred to the moulds using either ladles or a system of brick channels specially constructed in the casting pit, through which the hot metal can then flow from the melting furnace into the space between the two moulds. Holes in the top of the mantle ensure that gases are able to escape. If gas remained in the metal, the bell would be porous and susceptible to cracking. Porousness can also develop if the mould is damp, is not at the proper temperature, or if the metal, when poured, is not hot enough. The bell is allowed to cool for several days. Large bells can take over a week to cool completely. Small bells, those under 500 pounds (230 kg), can be removed from the moulding pit the following day.
