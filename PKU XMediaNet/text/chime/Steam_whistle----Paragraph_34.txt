Acoustic length  or effective length  is the quarter wavelength generated by the whistle. It is calculated as one quarter the ratio of speed of sound to the whistle’s frequency. Acoustic length may differ from the whistle’s physical length, also termed geometric length. depending upon mouth configuration, etc. The end correction is the difference between the acoustic length and the physical length above the mouth. The end correction is a function of diameter whereas the ratio of acoustic length to physical length is a function of scale. These calculations are useful in whistle design to obtain a desired sounding frequency. Working length in early usage meant whistle acoustic length, i.e., the effective length of the working whistle, but recently has been used for physical length including the mouth.
