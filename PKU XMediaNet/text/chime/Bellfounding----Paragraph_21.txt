In the early days of bellfounding, bells were tuned using an imprecise method whereby the inside of the bell, or the edge of the lip, was chipped away. With the improvement of machinery, this was done using a lathe. The bell is cast with slightly thicker sides before being inverted, and gripped by vices, to keep it perfectly firm. The bell is then ground as it rotates on a circular lathe to acquire the precise tone. The bell tuner must be highly skilled as it takes years of experience to know how much metal to remove. By this means, bells can be very accurately tuned.
