A Tower Swing is when the bell is rung and then swung down and a bit behind the ringer and back up to a normal position. Doing this creates an "echo" effect. The mouth of the bell must rotate around to create the sound change that resemble a tower bell. Usually this is done over a period of three or four beats' worth of time.
