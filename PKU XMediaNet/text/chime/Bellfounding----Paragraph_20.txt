Bells are manufactured with exact formulas, so that using the diameter it is possible to calculate precisely every dimension of the bell, and in turn its musical note, or tone. Much experimentation and testing has been devoted to determining the exact shape that will resonate the best tone. In general, the smaller the bell the higher the pitch, with the frequency of a bell's note varying with the square of its thickness, and inversely with its diameter. The thickness of a church bell at its thickest part (the "sound bow") is usually one thirteenth its diameter. If the bell is mounted as cast, without additional tuning after founding, it is called a "maiden bell". Russian bells are treated in this way and cast for a certain tone. "Tuned bells", which were common practice in Britain and Europe, are worked after casting to produce a precise note.
