Shaking is accomplished by rapidly ringing the bell back and forth so that the clapper strikes both the front and back of the bell casting in quick succession. This technique creates a continuous sound, as opposed to normal ringing in which the tone decays rapidly after being rung. Because of their size, bass bells are rarely shaken. Instead, if a shaking sound is desired from a bass bell, the bell is suspended and a mallet roll is played.
