Firstly the bell design is calculated to precise specifications where the bellmaker determines the shape that the bell will need to take in order to resonate with the proper number of vibrations and create the right sound and pitch. The bell pattern is then cut out in two wooden templates called "strickle boards". One of the boards matches the dimensions of the outer bell (called the case or cope); the other matches that of the inner bell (called the core). The boards are used to create the inner and outer moulds of the final bell.
