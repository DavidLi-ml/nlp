In casting, the tone of the bell is best left sharp, because it is much easier to flatten the tone than to sharpen it. A bell may readily be flattened one-eighth of a tone, or even more, but it cannot be sharpened so much; indeed, any sharpening is to be deprecated, and if at all possible should be avoided. The bell tone is tested frequently during the tuning process usually with tuning forks or an electronic stroboscopic tuning device commonly called a strobe tuner, which registers the vibrations as the bell is struck. If the tone is too low, the lathe operator grinds more metal off the lower edge of the bell. If the tone is too high, the bell is thinned with a file. The bell's strongest harmonics are tuned to be at octave intervals below the nominal note, but other notes also need to be brought into their proper relationship.
