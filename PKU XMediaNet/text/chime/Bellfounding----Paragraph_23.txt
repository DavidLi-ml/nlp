The clapper or tongue is manufactured in a similar process as the bell. Special care is given to cast the clapper at the proper weight, as a clapper that is too light will not bring out the true tones of the bell and a heavy clapper might cause the bell to crack. Holes are drilled into the top of the bell and the clapper is attached to the inside of the bell either by a metal link or by a leather strap. Finally the bell is installed in the tower.
