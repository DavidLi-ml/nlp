There are several major publishers providing printed handbell music such as the "Hope Publishing Company", "The Lorenz Corporation" and "Alfred Music Publishing" as well as free sites from individual composers and arrangers. Costs associated with handbell music typically result from shipping (many scores are only published in hard-copy) and dissemination; as most scores do not permit duplication and must be purchased individually for each ringer in the handbell choir.
