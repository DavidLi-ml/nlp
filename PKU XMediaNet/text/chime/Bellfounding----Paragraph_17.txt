Instead of using a steel mantle and cement, both the inner and outer moulds can also be made completely out of loam. In that case, the moulds are usually constructed inside out - first the inner mould on top of a coke, stone or brick core, then the false bell including wax decorations as above and finally the outer mould with added iron ring and fiber (e.g. hemp) reinforcements. Separating agents are used to prevent the false bell from sticking too closely to both of the moulds. Finally, after lifting up the outer mould, the false bell can be destroyed and the outer mould lowered back down onto the inner mould, ready for casting.
