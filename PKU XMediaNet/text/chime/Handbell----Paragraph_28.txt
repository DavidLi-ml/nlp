The Singing Bell technique creates a sustained pitch similar to the sound a wine glass makes as its rim is stroked with a wet fingertip, and is accomplished in much the same way. A short wooden dowel or stick is touched to the outside of the rim of a handbell, which is being held in the other hand. The dowel is then used to stroke the rim of the bell in a circular or "stirring" motion. The Singing Bell technique is adapted from the "Singing Bowl" tradition of Tibet.
