The chime at the Highland Arts Theatre (formerly St. Andrew's United Church) in Sydney, Nova Scotia still sings forth regularly and has become a part of the sound of the city's downtown. This is the original McShane Bell Foundry Ten Bell Chime, installed in the church as it was constructed in 1911. In December 2015 a video posted on Facebook of Sydney native Glenda Watt playing the Christmas carol “Angels We Have Heard on High” on the chime was viewed more than 1.6 million times within the first nine days of it being uploaded to the social networking site.
