Handbells can be played as a handbell tree where the handles are interlaced within each other, allowing multiple bells to be played with mallets to obtain an undamped sound. This performance technique was invented by Louise Frier in the 1980s. It was further developed by Barbara Brocker who developed a standardized bell layout. It is practiced by many handbell soloists. The notational symbol used for Handbell Trees features a series of interlocking diagonal lines, one for each handbell used. The pitch of each bell is placed at the lowest point of each diagonal line.
