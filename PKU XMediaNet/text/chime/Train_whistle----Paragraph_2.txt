Because trains generally have extremely high mass and relatively low braking friction, they are inherently difficult to stop at normal speeds. Some way of warning others of the approach of a train from a distance is necessary. Since train whistles were inexpensive compared to other warning devices, the use of loud and distinct train whistles became the preferred solution for railway operators.
