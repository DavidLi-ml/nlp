Thumb damp technique provides a staccato sound similar to plucking or malleting. This is often described as a "tinkling" sound. The bell is rung normally with a thumb or several fingers touching the outside of the bell below the rim. This damps the bell's sound immediately after it's rung. With smaller bells, this technique can often be easier than plucking or malleting because the bells don't have to lay on the table.
