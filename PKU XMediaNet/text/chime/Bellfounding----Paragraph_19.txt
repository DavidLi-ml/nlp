After the bell and equipment has cooled completely, the mould, containing the newly cast bell, is raised from the pit by the projecting trunnions of the bell case. The core plate is unclamped and the core broken out. The bell is then carefully extracted from the case. At this stage, any remaining loam still adhered to the bell is brushed away and flash (excess metal), which may have formed below the bell rim – owing to mould contraction in the presence of hot metal – is trimmed off. This completes the casting process.
