Professional-grade inflatable boats and RIBs have existed for many decades. Modern versions are complex, and they can be rapidly inflated using SCBA or scuba tanks as well as CO2 to make them mission ready. The professional-grade RIBs are available in many sizes and styles, some sporting T-tops, cabins, and other features. Since the late 1990s, many varieties of inflatable boats, RIBs, whitewater rafts, kayaks and sea kayaks, and canoes, have been developed by Asian, European, and North American companies.
