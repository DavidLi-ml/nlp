The Mackinaw boat hull's relative flexibility and efficient movement through the water became less important in the 20th century with the invention of the outboard motor and other powerboat innovations. Few new Mackinaw boats were built after the 1910s. A few Mackinaw boats began to be built after 1990 for explicit purposes of historical re-enactment and skills preservation.
