A Halkett boat is a type of lightweight inflatable boat designed by Lt Peter Halkett (1820â€“1885) during the 1840s. Halkett had long been interested in the difficulties of travelling in the Canadian Arctic, and the problems involved in designing boats light enough to be carried over arduous terrain, but robust enough to be used in extreme weather conditions.
