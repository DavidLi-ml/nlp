Generally, inflatable boats are manufactured with several inflatable chambers which means should one chamber be punctured the remaining chambers will keep the craft afloat. Should a chamber puncture it can be repaired while still underway with an inflatable repair kit, however it is advised that this type of repair is treated as temporary, with a permanent repair being carried out when on dry land. More extensive inflatable boat repairs are best carried out in a dry, warm, well ventilated indoor space away from dust and other contaminants. Room humidity is important for a lasting repair as specific humidity over 70% will produce a repair with a shorter lifespan.
