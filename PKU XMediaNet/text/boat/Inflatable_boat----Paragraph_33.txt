Today's more advanced inflatable boats are manufactured using supported fabric. They are made of rubberized, synthetic fabrics CSM Hypalon/neoprene, PVC or Polyurethane, providing light-weight and airtight sponsons. Depending on fabric choice, the fabric panels are assembled using either hot or cold manufacturing processes. Different styles of one-way valves are used to add or remove air, and some brands include inter-communicating valves that reduce the effect of a puncture. Boats are available in many floor choices, such as the ribbed air floor, High Pressure (HPP) Air Floor, fiberglass (RIB), and aluminum or wood panels for rigidity.
