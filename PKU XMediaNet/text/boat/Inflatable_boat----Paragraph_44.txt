Clean both the site of repair and the patch with a cleaning fluid. This should be Toluene for rubber based boats (Hypalon, EPDM, Neoprene) and Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK) for PVC based boats if available, or rubbing alcohol if not. Wait no longer than 30 minutes between cleaning and applying adhesive.
