Inflatable sailboats are a small but growing niche in the recreational market. Sail rigs are now offered for inflatable dinghies, kayaks and catamarans. In keeping with the portability of the inflatable hull, the components of the sail attachment fold or come apart to fit in a compact bundle. Leeboards on the sides perform the same function as a centerboard, to enable these boats to tack into the wind.
