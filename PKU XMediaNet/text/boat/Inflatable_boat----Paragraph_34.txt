Inflatable boats that have transoms have an inflatable keel to create a "deep-v" along the line of the hull improving the hull's wave cutting and turning performance. Due to the light weight of these vessels, if powering with an engine, it is best to put weight in the bow area as the bow will rise while the boat is going up on plane.
