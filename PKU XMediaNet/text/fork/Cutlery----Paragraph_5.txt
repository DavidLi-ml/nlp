Sterling silver is the traditional material from which good quality cutlery is made (hence the usage of the term in the United States). Sets of such cutlery are a valuable component of household silver and are stored and maintained carefully. Whole sets are created, sometimes specifically for wealthy clients, containing a range of specialised dining implements, such as the comprehensive set in sterling silver made for the French aristocrat Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier (known as the Marquis de Lafayette) by the Towle Manufacturing Company. It contained, among many other items, a gravy ladle, mustard spoon and lettuce fork.
