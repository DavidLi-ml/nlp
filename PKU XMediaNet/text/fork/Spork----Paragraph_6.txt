Materials such as stainless steel, silver, aluminum, titanium, and polycarbonate plastic have been used in spork manufacture. Plastic sporks are common in prisons in the United States because they are difficult to form into shiv-type weapons. Prepackaged meals may come with a disposable plastic spork. Sporks are also frequently used by backpackers and other outdoorsmen as they are a lightweight and space-saving alternative to carrying both a fork and spoon.
