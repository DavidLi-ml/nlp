Fibrillation also occurs with individual skeletal muscle fibers. This happens when muscle ﬁbers lose contact with their innervating axon producing a spontaneous action potential, "fibrillation potential" that results in the muscle fiber's contraction. These contractions are not visible under the skin and are detectable through needle electromyography (EMG) and ultrasound. Fibrillations can occur in healthy individuals. If the fibrillation have irregular potentials then they don't have pathological significance. In other cases they are a major symptom in acute and severe peripheral nerve disorders, in myopathies in which muscle ﬁbers are split or inflamed, and lower motor neuron lesions.
