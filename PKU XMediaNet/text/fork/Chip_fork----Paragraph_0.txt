A chip fork is a small fork made from wood or plastic that is given away by fast food suppliers with portions of french fries, currywurst, and similar, and used when eating. Chip forks are specially designed to keep eaters fingers clean of grease, sauces, mayonnaise, and other, while at the same time being cheap enough to be thrown away after use. Thus they spare suppliers the cost and labour of collecting and cleaning traditional forks. This fits well with the image of fast food as kinds of products to be taken away and being consumed elsewhere.
