Japan: shorter length sticks of about 23 centimetres (9.1 in) tapering to a finely pointed end. Japanese chopsticks are traditionally made of wood or bamboo and are lacquered. It is common for Japanese sticks to be of shorter length for women. Children's chopsticks, in smaller sizes, are common. Many Japanese chopsticks have circumferential grooves at the eating end, which helps prevent food sliding.
