A crab fork (similar to, and sometimes synonymous with, a shrimp fork) is a very small fork for extracting flesh from a crab or lobster. Crab forks may be special-purpose food utensils decorated or constructed specifically for crabs and lobsters, or may simply be very small forks sold or used for the purpose.
