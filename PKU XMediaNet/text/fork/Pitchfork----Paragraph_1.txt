A pitchfork is an agricultural tool with a long handle and long, thick, widely separated pointed tynes used to lift and pitch or throw loose material, such as hay, straw or leaves. True pitchforks typically have only two or three tines, while manure forks have four or more tines. However, some forks with more than three tines are also used for handling loose material such as hay or silage. Other types of fork even up to ten tines with different lengths and spacing depending on purpose. They are usually made of steel with a long wooden handle, but may also be made from wood, wrought iron, bamboo, alloy, etc. In some parts of England a pitchfork is known as a prong and, in parts of Ireland, a sprong refers to a 4-pronged pitchfork. The pitchfork is similar to the shorter and sturdier garden fork.
