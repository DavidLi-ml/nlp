Gate valves are actuated by a threaded stem which connects the actuator (e.g. handwheel or motor) to the gate. They are characterised as having either a rising or a nonrising stem, depending on which end of the stem is threaded. Rising stems are fixed to the gate and rise and lower together as the valve is operated, providing a visual indication of valve position. The actuator takes the form of a nut which is rotated around the threaded stem to move it. Nonrising stem valves are fixed to, and rotate with, the actuator, and are threaded into the gate. They may have a pointer threaded onto the upper end of the stem to indicate valve position, since the gate's motion is concealed inside the valve. Nonrising stems are used underground or where vertical space is limited.
