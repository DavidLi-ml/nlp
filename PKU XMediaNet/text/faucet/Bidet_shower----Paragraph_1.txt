The health faucet is a source of water for people who prefer using water rather than other methods of anal cleansing. The bidet shower is a relatively modern replacement for the traditional sources of water for this action, such as the bidet, copper pot or bucket and mug, being more hygienic and compact. There is no contact between the spray of water and the used water drainage.
