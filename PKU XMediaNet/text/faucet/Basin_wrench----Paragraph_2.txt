The fixed jaw is attached to the shaft with a pivot pin so that the entire jaw assembly can rotate about an axis perpendicular to the shaft. This permits the jaws to be rotated over the end of the shaft so that they can be "flipped" over, to allow the tool to be used to either tighten or loosen a fastener. Mechanical stops limit this rotation to 180Â° so that when the jaws assembly is resting at a stop, the jaws will be perpendicular to the shaft and thus aligned to the fastener. When the shaft is held in a vertical orientation, the jaws are automatically held against the stop by gravity. Basin wrenches are available with both fixed-length and telescopic handles.
