A faucet aerator can be classified on the basis of its flow rate and the type of water stream (aerated, non-aerated, spray) it produces. In general, standard-sized aerators are available with female (M22x1) or male threading (M24x1). Bathtub spouts often have a bigger diameter with a male M28x1 thread. The United States use different thread sizes: 15/16"-27 for standard-sized male and 55/64"-27 for standard-sized female threads.
