The bidet shower is very common in parts of Asia where water is considered essential for anal cleansing. This includes India, Turkey, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, China, and Cambodia. In those countries it is commonly installed in Western-style (sitting) toilet installations. In Thailand, it is common in both Western-style toilets and squat toilet installations. The bidet shower is similar in intent (if not method of use) to the Japanese washlet-style toilet seats, or so-called "electronic bidets".
