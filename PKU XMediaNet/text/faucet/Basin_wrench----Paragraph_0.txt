A basin wrench, sometimes called a sink wrench, is a plumbing tool that is used in confined spaces to turn fasteners that would be difficult or impossible to reach with a plumber wrench or other types of wrenches. For example, the threaded nuts used to secure faucets to sinks are often located in deeply recessed places that can only be accessed with a basin wrench.
