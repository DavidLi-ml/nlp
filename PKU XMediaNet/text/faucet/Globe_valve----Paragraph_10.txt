The cage is a part of the valve that surrounds the plug and is located inside the body of the valve. Typically, the cage is one of the greatest determiners of flow within the valve. As the plug is moved more of the openings in the cage are exposed and flow is increased and vice versa. The design and layout of the openings can have a large effect on flow of material (the flow characteristics of different materials at temperatures, pressures that are in a range). Cages are also used to guide the plug to the seat of the valve for a good shutoff, substituting the guiding from the bonnet.
