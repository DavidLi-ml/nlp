Automatic faucets are common in public washrooms, particularly in airports and hotels, where they are supposed to reduce water consumption (however, some evidence to the contrary has been published) and reduce the transmission of disease causing microbes. They can also be found in some kitchens and in the washrooms of some private residences. Other uses include providing drinking water to pets or livestock, whereby the presence of an animal allows water to flow into a watering trough or dish.
