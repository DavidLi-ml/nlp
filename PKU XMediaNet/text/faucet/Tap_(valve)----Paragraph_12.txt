Taps are normally connected to the water supply by means of a "swivel tap connector", which is attached to the end of the water pipe using a soldered or compression fitting, and has a large nut to screw onto the threaded "tail" of the tap, which hangs down underneath the bath, basin or sink. A fibre washer (which expands when wet, aiding the seal) is used between the connector and the tap tail. Tap tails are normally 1/2" in diameter for sinks and 3/4" for baths, although continental Europe sometimes uses a 3/8" (still imperial) size. The same connection method is used for a ballcock.
