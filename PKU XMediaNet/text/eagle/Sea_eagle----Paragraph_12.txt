Their closest relatives are the fishing eagles in the genus Ichthyophaga, very similar to the tropical Haliaeetus species. The relationships to other genera in the family are less clear; they have long been considered closer to the genus Milvus (kites) than to the true eagles in the genus Aquila on the basis of their morphology and display behaviour, more recent genetic evidence agrees with this, but points to them being related to the genus Buteo (buzzards), as well, a relationship not previously thought close.
