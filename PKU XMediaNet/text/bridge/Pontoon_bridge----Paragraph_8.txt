The expected life of a pontoon bridge is normally short, from a few hours, to weeks or months, and the design has to take account of the expected life. Some bridges have been designed and survived much longer. In Hobart a long pontoon bridge built in 1943 was only replaced after 21 years. The fourth Galata Bridge that spans the Golden Horn in Istanbul, Turkey was built in 1912 and operated for 80 years.
