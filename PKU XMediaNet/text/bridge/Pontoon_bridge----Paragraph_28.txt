In 1862 the Union forces commanded by Major General Ambrose Burnside were stuck on the wrong side of the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg for lack of the arrival of the Pontoon train resulting in severe losses.  The report of this disaster resulted in Britain forming and training a Pontoon Troop of Engineers.
