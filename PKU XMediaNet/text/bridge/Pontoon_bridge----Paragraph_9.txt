Precautions are needed to protect a pontoon bridge from becoming damaged. The bridge can be dislodged or inundated whenever the load limit of the bridge is exceeded. A pontoon bridge can also become overloaded when one section of the bridge is weighted down much more heavily than the other parts. The bridge can be induced to sway or oscillate in a hazardous manner because of the regular stride of a group of soldiers, or from other types of repeated loads. Flotsam and heavy floating objects can also accumulate on the pontoons, increasing the drag from river current and potentially damaging the bridge. Fire, storms, floods and ice are harder to protect against. See below for floating pontoon failures and disasters.
