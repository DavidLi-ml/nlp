Also known as a Sergio slide (named after the Brazilian inventor of the move, Sergio Yuppie), a layback is a frontside slide performed while riding downhill by placing your uphill hand on the ground behind the tail of your board and breaking the rear wheels out of traction. From here you can rotate 180 degrees, swing a pendulum, or hold the slide at 90 degrees and thrust your pelvis upward to unweight the board, resulting in a longer slide. The last variation is considered to be the most challenging and stylish, but often results in flatspots on your wheels. Like all hands-down slides, this trick requires slide gloves to be executed at speed.
