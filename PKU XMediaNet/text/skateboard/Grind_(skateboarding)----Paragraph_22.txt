This is a tailslide where the nose of the board goes over the rail/ledge instead of staying on the side the skater approached from. This trick is usually done on a ledge so the trucks can land properly (with the nose pointing up), but it can be done on a rail as well. A bluntslide is to a tailslide as an overcrook is to a crooked.
