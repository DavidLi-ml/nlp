Same as a blunt slide, only performed with the nose and the front wheels. 90 degree ollie over the object to be sliding, locking the nose into a slide position. Wheels drag across the ledge/platform like a power slide while the nose slides along the lip. on a rail, the rider 'ollies over' into a nose slide position.
