This is a backside slide where the rider puts both hands on the street in front of their toes and extends their body out into a push-up position (you can also keep your knees bent in order to spin around faster), either returning to the original stance with a pendulum or rotating a full 180 degrees. A more difficult variation is to put only your uphill hand on the pavement and slide with your shoulders perpendicular to the ground. Toeside 360s can be done by continuing immediately into a frontside slide after the first 180 degrees.
