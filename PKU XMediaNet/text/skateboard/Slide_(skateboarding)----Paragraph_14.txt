The powerslide is a four wheel slide usually performed to stop the skateboard. It is performed by gaining speed, and turning the board 90 degrees while leaning the body back. The hands do not touch the ground when performing a powerslide. The skater can also turn the board more than 90 degrees resulting in the board continuing to roll and a very stylish maneuver. If the rider is going fast enough downhill it is possible to do powerslide rotations. Can also be done leaning forward but must be rotated the opposite way, which makes it similar to a bert slide but without placing the hand on the ground.
