In skateboarding, Grinds are tricks that involve the skateboarder sliding along an object using the trucks of a skateboard rather than the wheels. Grinds can be performed on any object narrow enough to fit between wheels and are often performed on the coping (edge) of a skate ramp, a purpose-built "funbox", step, ledge or horizontally-positioned pole.
