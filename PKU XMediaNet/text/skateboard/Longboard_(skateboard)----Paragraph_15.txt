Drop-Through boards, not to be confused with a double drop deck, have a cutout in the deck, allowing the baseplates of the trucks to be mounted through the deck. The lowered platform allows for greater stability at high speeds. Some examples of drop-through decks are the Landyachtz Drop Speed, Jaseboards Drop, Rayne Vendetta, Bustin Maestro, Original Freeride series, the Sector 9 Motha Star and the Loaded Tan Tien.
