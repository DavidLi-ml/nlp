Another downhill slide requiring slide gloves, a surrender slide is when a rider places both hands on the street in front of their board and lowers their upper body close to the pavement, extending their legs behind them and gripping the board with the sides of their feet. While not a particularly difficult or impressive slide, it is useful for linking together various other downhill slides. The wheels do not necessarily slide in a surrender because the deck remains pointing downhill, although it is possible to drift in this position.
