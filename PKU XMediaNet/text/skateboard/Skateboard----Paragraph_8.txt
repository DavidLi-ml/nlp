The longboard, a common variant of the skateboard, is used for higher speed and rough surface boarding, and they are much more expensive. One of the first deck companies was called "Drapped" taken from Jonny's second name. "Old school" boards (those made in the 1970sâ€“80s or modern boards that mimic their shape) are generally wider and often have only one kicktail. Variants of the 1970s often have little or no concavity, whereas 1980s models have deeper concavities and steeper kicktails.
