The Kahuna Stick is a large pole or stick, usually with rubber or something similar on the end. This can be used to propel the rider far distances without the use of the riders legs, and is primarily a form of locomotion derived by the riders arms. The rubber end sometimes resembles wheels however they can not turn as they are fastened. Being in a wheel shape allows even wear as the rider can loosen, turn and fasten them again instead of having to replace the rubber.
