This is a four wheeled slide performed on inclines, banks, ditches, and transition. most common riding frontside or straight up the transition. At the peak of momentum, the rider unweights the board and slides the back wheels up to 'catch up' with the rest of the body at 90 degrees. Then as the body's momentum returns, the rider pivots the back truck while sliding the front wheels 90 degrees back toward the bottom of the incline. Simply put, backside shred up, pivot back down. A fun lazy way of riding transition backside. if you ride up frontside, you do this trick in a backside 'alley-oop' fashion. This is also VERY common in backyard pool riding, due the benefits of 'feeling' your way around the cement.
