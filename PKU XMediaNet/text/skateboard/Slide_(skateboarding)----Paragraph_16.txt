This is where a rider wearing sliding gloves performs a frontside slide using their downhill hand with the glove to break the wheels free of traction while swinging the uphill hand close to the body to revert the board back from the initial slide in a pendulum motion. Named after slalom champion and sliding godfather Cliff Coleman, it is regarded as a staple trick in downhill sliding because it allows riders to see what is coming at them (objects, cars, hazards) all while in control, as well as allow them to slow down. A Coleman slide can also be used to initiate a frontside spin if the rider ends the slide at 180 degrees instead of swinging back to the original stance with a pendulum. If the rider flows into a backside slide with one smooth motion, it is possible to do 360 spins and more.
