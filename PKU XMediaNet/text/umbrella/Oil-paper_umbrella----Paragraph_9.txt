The art on the Chinese style of oil-paper umbrellas are majorly focused on tradition black and white Chinese painting such as flowers, birds and scenery. Others include scenes from famous Chinese literature, such as Dream of the Red Chamber and Romance of the West Chamber. Yet, some have Chinese calligraphy instead of paintings. However, traditional colors are kept on the sticks and the scaffold of the umbrella to maintain the antiquity.
