Umbrella hats have a typical umbrella canopy, with ribs supporting a fabric or plastic covering. This canopy is connected to a headband via four short shafts on every other rib to keep the canopy over the head. The canopy is generally collapsable, with the ribs and fabric collapsing around the headband shafts, much like a typical umbrella. Umbrella hats can come in a wide array of colors, and sizes, including national flags like the British Flag.
