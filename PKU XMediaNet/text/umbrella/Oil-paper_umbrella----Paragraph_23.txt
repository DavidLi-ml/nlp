In 1900, Liang Jingting (Chinese: 梁敬庭), who worked in an umbrella shop in Changsha opened his own umbrella shop called the "梁宏發傘". It produces the old type of oil, black ink umbrella. The beautiful name "湘潭木屐 靖港油傘" is attributed to its fine features and endurance. In 1921, the 潘饋清 brothers started a factory called "菲菲傘" that mass-produces umbrella skin paper. The umbrella skin it produced included traditional flowered ones and many other pictures, these umbrellas were exported to Hong Kong, Macau and South East Asia. The umbrella was awarded in a Chinese exhibition in 1929. The highest production rate was thirty thousand per year until February 1975. "靖港雨傘社" was abolished, and 靖港 oil paper umbrella production was terminated.
