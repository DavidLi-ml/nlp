On December 5, 2006, artisan Liu youquan (劉有泉) met a government official of the Yuhang district and proposed to recover the oil paper umbrella in Yuhan, with the intention of starting a new pop culture and increase the local wealth. Liu spent a few hundred RMB and bought some dozens of bamboo umbrella from an bamboo umbrella factory. But Liu did not have the skills, only to keep these as a "canvas" for 30 some years. A local media reported for a search of an oil paper umbrella artisan and increased local awareness. Four days later, four artisans:Fang Jinquan (房金泉), Chen Yuexiang (陳月祥), Shen Lihua (沈麗華), and Sun Shuigen (孫水根) prompted and have intentions to recover the art (drawing oil paintings on the bamboo umbrella). They have passed their skills and technique to some local bamboo farmers and brought income to them. The governmental officials of Yuhang have listed this art for major protection and important antique artifact (Antiquities Act).
