The spread of oil-paper umbrellas was started by the invention of Yun (雲氏), wife of Luban (魯班). "Chop bamboo sticks to thin strips, covered in animal fur, closed to become a cane, opened as a cone." But early umbrella materials were mostly feathers or silks, later replaced by paper. When oil paper umbrellas first appeared is unknown. Some estimate that they spread across to Korea and Japan during the Tang dynasty. It was commonly called the "green oil paper umbrella" during the Song dynasty. The popularity grew and the oil paper umbrella became commonplace during the Ming dynasty. They are often mentioned in popular Chinese literature.
