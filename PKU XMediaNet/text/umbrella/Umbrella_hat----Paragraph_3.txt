Robert W. Patten claimed that he invented the umbrella hat while he was prospecting in Mexico. His original hat also included a mosquito net attached to the canopy. Patten moved to Seattle in the 1890s and was dubbed the Umbrella Man. He then became a repairman for umbrellas, and inspired a cartoon from John Hager, depicting Robert Patten with his umbrella hat. Patten was seen as eccentric, and Hager's cartoons of him were comic.
