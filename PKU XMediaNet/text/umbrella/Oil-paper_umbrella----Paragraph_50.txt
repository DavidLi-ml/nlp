During the Azuchi-Momoyama period, Luzon Sukezaemon introduced an umbrella with a shield from the Philippines, which contributed the popularity of the wagasa. During the Genroku era, modifications were made to enhance its utility to specific circumstances. Some monks and doctors used shorter and thicker umbrellas with business trademarks or logos on them, then lent them to customers as advertisement. Umbrellas also became the geisha's tool as well. In addition, some unemployed Edo period samurai crafted oil paper umbrellas as a secondary occupation. A famous example is the Ajima-kasa (阿島傘), made in Nagano Prefecture, which is still made there.
