Oil-paper umbrella production started in Yodoe, Tottori in 1821, by the Kurayoshiya (倉吉屋). During the Meji period, the production in Yodoe was only about a few thousand annually. However, due to the abundance and accessibility of bamboo and other raw materials, during the Taishō period, production by factories increased 71% and a net production of 17,000 Wagasa annually. Most areas in western Japan regularly used the Yodoe Wagasa.
