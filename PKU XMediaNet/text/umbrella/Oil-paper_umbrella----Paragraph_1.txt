Other than the purpose of providing shade, oil-paper umbrellas are also traditional essential wedding items. In both traditional Chinese and Japanese weddings, the matron of honour would cover the bride with the oil-paper umbrella upon arrival to ward off evil spirits. Purple umbrellas are a symbol of longevity for the elders, while white umbrellas are used in funerals. Oil-paper umbrellas are also used as props in Japanese traditional dances and tea ceremonies.
