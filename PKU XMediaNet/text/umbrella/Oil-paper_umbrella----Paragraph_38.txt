Since many of the Hakka populations are in the mountainous areas of China, most corpses are buried on the mountains. Initially, Hakka people do not put up a grave stone, however, after the second time the corpse is buried (usually 3â€“5 years later), the additional grander ceremony is added. When burying, usually in the eighth month on the Chinese calendar, an experienced burial master is hired to dig the old burial and inter the clean bones for an official and permanent burial at the exact spot. The oil-paper umbrella is used to cover the bones while they are being cleaned.
