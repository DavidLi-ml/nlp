A more recent variant of the umbrella stand used in modern retailers is the umbrella bag dispenser, which allows the user to insert the umbrella into a disposable waterproof bag when entering a building so as not to get the floors wet. This obviates the need for multiple umbrellas to be stored in the stand and the potential for improper retrieval of the wrong umbrella. This is placed at the entrance to shops and hotels and other commercial buildings where storage of large numbers of umbrellas could be problematic.
