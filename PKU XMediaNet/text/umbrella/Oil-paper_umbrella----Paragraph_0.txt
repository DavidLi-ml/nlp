Oil-paper umbrella (‹The template Lang-zh is being considered for merging.›  Chinese: 油紙傘, pinyin: yóuzhǐsǎn, Mandarin pronunciation: [i̯ǒu̯ʈʂɨ̀sàn]) is a type of paper umbrella that originated from China. It subsequently spread across Asia, to Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Burma, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Laos. People in these countries have further developed the oil paper umbrella with different characteristics. As the Hakka moved to Taiwan, the oil-paper umbrella also began to develop in Taiwan.
