The umbrella fund structure makes it cheaper for investors to move from one sub-fund to another and save the investment manager costs relating to regulatory duplication. An umbrella fund can be also a scheme set up to provide retirement, death and other benefits to members of a participating employer. In an umbrella fund there are several participating employers who enjoy more or less the same benefits and the fund is managed by professional trustees. They cut the cost by saving on maintenance and management fees and sometimes take advantage of reduced tax rates. An umbrella fund is appropriate for employers who lack size to extract scale benefits from a stand-alone fund.
