The rumours of the local people have guessed that the oil paper umbrella have been brought into Thailand by the Bamar. Long ago, a monk in Thailand named "Pra Inthaa" who practiced Buddhism in "Wat Bo Sang" temple and travelled a lot. One time as he approached near the Northern border of Burma and stayed there for a few days, the Thai people there accommodated him while his stay. During a time when Pra Inthaa ate his breakfast, a Bamar gave him an umbrella along with the prayer of the monk. The monk thought the umbrella was very convenient and was curious for how it was made, he decided to learn to make the umbrella. Thus he visited the village that was specialized in the production of umbrella located in Burma. Pra Inthaa recorded the detailed production procedures and brought it with him back to Wat Bo Sang temple.
