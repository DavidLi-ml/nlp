After Western umbrella have increased popularity, the Luzho oil paper umbrella have diminished dramatically, in addition, due to the sophisticated procedures, the high production cost and low profit, not many young men are willing to commit to this art. In 2004, only about thirty experienced artisans are willing to continue this umbrella production. Many people worried that the skills may soon become extinct. In 2005 October, an exhibition in Shanghai invited the local government to an exhibition of oil paper umbrellas, and they have recovered some popularity since then.
