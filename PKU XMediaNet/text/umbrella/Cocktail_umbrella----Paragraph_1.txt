The umbrella is fashioned out of paper, which can be patterned, with cardboard ribs. The ribs are made from cardboard in order to provide flexibility and to hinge so the umbrella can be pulled shut much like an ordinary umbrella. A small plastic retaining ring is often fashioned against the stem, a toothpick, in order to prevent the umbrella from folding up spontaneously. Also note that there is a sleeve of folded newspaper under the collar to act as a spacer. This newspaper is usually Japanese, Chinese or Indian hinting at the umbrella's origin.
