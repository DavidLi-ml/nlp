In traditional Hakka marriages, the bride's parents must pay dowry to the husband's family, in which oil paper umbrella is one of the required dowries. "紙" (Paper) is a homonym for "子" (sons) in Chinese, for the connotation of having sons early. The character "傘" (umbrella), contains five "人" (man) with the connotation of lots of sons and grandsons. Oil paper umbrella is straight up, with the symbol to eradicate evil spirits. The circular appearance symbolizes "fullness" connotation of a beautiful marriage. And since the umbrella itself can shield rain and wind, thus prohibiting evil spirits from entering in. Other dowries that come with the oil paper umbrella include five colored pants, make up table, door curtain and boxes. In wealthier families, dowries could include god and jewelry or high quality cloth or blankets. In addition, bride family would give vegetables that have homonym with positive words such as 芹菜, 大蒜, 香蔥, 韭菜 that are then tied with red rope given as gifts to the husband's family. Oil paper umbrella as a dowry is still a custom in the Hakka family in Taiwan and some other countries in South East Asia.
