Some of their DVD and Blu Ray releases have been greatly appreciated for the HD mastering and inclusion of Extras and special features. Extras have been sourced through NFSA, with directors and their family members gaining access to previously unseen archival images, footage and interviews. The extras typically include interviews with producers, actors, historians, original advertising, commentaries and original artwork. Licenses for these Extras have been granted for online download/VOD, TV and DVD platforms all across the World.
