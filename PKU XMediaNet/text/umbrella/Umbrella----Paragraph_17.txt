Cultural changes among the Aristoi of Greece eventually led to a brief period - between 505 and 470BC - where men used parasols. Vase iconography bears witness to a transition from men carrying swords, then spears, then staffs, then parasols, to eventually nothing. The parasol, at that time of its fashion, displayed the luxury of the user's lifestyle. During the period of their usage, Greek style was inspired by the Persian and Lydian nobilityâ€™s way of dressing: loose robes, long decorated hair, gold, jewellery, and perfume.
