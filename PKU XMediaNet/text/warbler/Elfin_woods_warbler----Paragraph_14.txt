The IUCN first evaluated the status of the elfin woods warbler in 1988. At the time it was given a classification of lower risk/least concern. In 1994, its status was changed to lower risk/near threatened and in 2000, its status was changed to vulnerable, where it remains. The justification for maintaining the species' status as vulnerable is that "There are no direct or immediate threats, but the combination of a very small range and population may have important implications for its chances of long-term survival, and this species consequently qualifies as vulnerable".
